{\an8}EPISODE EIGHT
WE MUST BECOME ICARUS

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,712
{\an8}Excuse me.

3
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:07,298
{\an8}We are the ones who posted that problem.

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,967
Were you able to solve it

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,301
in only half a day?

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,347
No, I'm not the one who solved it!

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,599
Look, the author is a man.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,520
I'm merely a library assistant.

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,231
I posted the reply on my master's behalf.

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,276
Oh, I see. I apologize then.

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:31,239
In that case,
could we meet with your master?

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,410
Uh, I'm afraid he's not available.

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,828
He'll be away for a while!

14
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,830
How long might that be?

15
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,752
A while.

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,214
Very well.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,092
I'd like to pass him a message,

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,845
but this isn't the place.

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,264
{\an8}If you don't mind,

20
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,225
{\an8}could you take us somewhere private?

21
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,711
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

22
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,322
Come to think of it,
we haven't introduced ourselves.

23
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,867
My name is Oczy.

24
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,453
Pleased to meet you. My name is Jolenta.

25
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,039
I, uh...

26
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,499
work as Badeni's--

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,334
- He's my servant.
- Huh?

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,003
I'm Badeni.

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,716
I've been sent by the Central Abbey
to serve as village subdeacon.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,719
You mean <i>that</i> Central Abbey?

31
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,846
Yes. <i>That</i> one.

32
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,849
Wow, I've never met anyone from there.

33
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,478
If I may ask, what is your position
on the problem of universals?

34
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,982
I'm a nominalist. I support Abelard.

35
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,066
I'm also...

36
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,944
Er, my master is also a nominalist.

37
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,529
He supports Ockham.

38
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,532
Ockham is fairly radical, isn't he?

39
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:25,079
Yes, but the pursuit of truth
requires a certain boldness.

40
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,707
How courageous.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,626
I'm quite impressed.

42
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,461
No, it's nothing like that.

43
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,297
Did you apply that stance
to my problem too?

44
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,340
Yes.

45
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,635
Oh, I mean, that's what my master said!

46
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,806
We're in luck.

47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,975
We've met the perfect person.

48
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,976
Right.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,771
Her master must be smart
to hire such a clever maid.

50
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,857
Huh? Obviously, she's the author.

51
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,943
What? Really?

52
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,987
She'll be a valuable resource.

53
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,449
She solved that problem in half a day.

54
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,035
Best of all,

55
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,414
we can probably talk to her
without fear of being turned in.

56
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,333
Huh? Why's that?

57
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,751
Because she's a woman.

58
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,548
If she turns us in,
she's likely to be charged as a witch.

59
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,134
A woman works to our advantage.

60
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,263
- That's rather cruel!
- It's reality.

61
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,392
But I only mean that a woman
is more advantageous than a man.

62
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,311
Whether we tell her or not

63
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,313
remains to be seen.

64
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,112
So, what is your message?

65
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,863
I must say,

66
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,074
your master is a very remarkable man.

67
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,035
Only someone well-versed in astronomy

68
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,705
could solve that problem in half a day.

69
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,748
Do you really think so?

70
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,709
Yes, of course.

71
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,795
Since you're working under such a man,

72
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,589
are you interested in astronomy too?

73
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,468
Huh? Uh, well... a little.

74
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,054
That's wonderful!

75
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,557
Astronomy is a fascinating subject.

76
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,685
I especially enjoy
ancient models of the universe.

77
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,520
How can I put it...

78
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,855
They're so imaginative!

79
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,024
Indeed.

80
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:20,236
People of long ago
had some fairly astounding ideas.

81
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,114
You could call it free in a way.

82
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,243
Out of curiosity, are you familiar
with the pagan Heraclides?

83
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,621
Yes.

84
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,124
Oh, my! Then what about Philolaus?

85
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,627
He was the one
with that ridiculous theory, right?

86
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,672
Amazing.

87
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,382
You are quite well-informed.

88
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,384
Yes.

89
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,888
As I recall,
the "ridiculous theory" you speak of

90
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:52,477
<i>was that a mysterious "central fire"
exists at the center of the universe.</i>

91
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,357
<i>Humankind lives on a side of the Earth
where the fire can't be seen.</i>

92
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,653
<i>Meanwhile, the Earth and the Sun
move in circles around the fire.</i>

93
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,367
Um, should we really
be talking about this?

94
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,910
You know...

95
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,537
In terms of faith.

96
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm a church official.

97
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,125
Don't be afraid.

98
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,920
Right!

99
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,671
That's a relief.

100
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:26,928
Philolaus's theory does seem
a bit laughable in this day and age.

101
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,347
I agree.

102
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,309
Creating a model of the universe
where the Earth moves...

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,812
It's far too audacious, isn't it?

104
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,771
Yes.

105
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,274
After all, it was God's will

106
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,860
that placed Earth
at the center of the universe.

107
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,281
It's the burden of original sin

108
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,909
and evidence that the Earth
is an unhappy place.

109
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,161
Indeed.

110
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,415
In that case,
have you heard of Aristarchus?

111
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,751
- No.
- Is that so?

112
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,922
He proposed a theory similar
to the ridiculous one we're discussing.

113
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,175
However, his ideas were a bit different.

114
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,720
Rather than use
subjective reasoning like Philolaus,

115
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,516
his theory was based on observable facts.

116
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,687
What exactly is this about?

117
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,026
Oh, a globe! How rare.

118
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,027
May I touch it?

119
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,529
Yes, go ahead.

120
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,324
Still,

121
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,828
Aristarchus's model
also contained many contradictions,

122
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,121
and it was forgotten.

123
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,666
I'm afraid I don't see
where this is going.

124
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,376
Could we discuss your message?

125
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,920
We are discussing it.

126
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,172
Huh?

127
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,756
What if

128
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,385
the ridiculous theories
of those men were to spread?

129
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,805
There would be chaos!

130
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,807
Their ideas blaspheme against the Church.

131
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,895
It would challenge authority
and all our assumptions.

132
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,564
We couldn't keep the world we have now.

133
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,776
Do you want to keep it the way it is?

134
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,570
What?

135
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,779
What if

136
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,200
we are born with not only sin

137
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,994
but freedom as well?

138
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,580
What would you do

139
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,666
if many of the things we obey and believe,

140
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,002
and the reality we perceive,

141
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,172
are actually lies?

142
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,383
Huh? That's unthinkable.

143
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,427
It defies common sense.

144
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,931
That's true within the bounds
of common sense.

145
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,143
But within the bounds
of these ridiculous theories...

146
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,691
What if our world

147
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,653
really does move?

148
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,488
Huh?

149
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,323
What?!

150
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,327
In that universe, God assigns no classes,

151
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,248
and there is no basis
for enduring despair.

152
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,625
Please stop!

153
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,085
This is improper!

154
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,379
Yes, you're right.

155
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,672
It's improper.

156
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,259
It will never lead us
in the right direction.

157
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,344
We'd have only one thing to pursue.

158
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,764
Truth.

159
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,645
{\an8}Please...

160
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,107
Please leave.

161
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,530
Very well.

162
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,865
Please tell this to the author.

163
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,161
We'll be waiting
by the bulletin board in the afternoon.

164
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,668
Will this really be okay?

165
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,461
Yeah, it's fine.

166
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,630
One look at her face tells me so.

167
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,133
Because she's a woman?

168
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,135
No.

169
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,096
Because she's a scholar.

170
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,600
The Earth is moving?

171
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,519
That's... the truth?

172
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,480
{\an8}How terrifying.

173
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,192
{\an8}How could someone
research something like that?

174
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,238
I've been interested in pagan ideas too,

175
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,366
but the sin of studying them
is on another level.

176
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,454
Oh, no. I have to report this to Kolbe!

177
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,833
<i>At this rate,</i>

178
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,420
<i>I could be charged as a witch
for associating with heretics.</i>

179
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,840
Even so, I have to tell him!

180
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,302
God will never forgive
something like this.

181
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,972
Kolbe!

182
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,772
Oh, they must be at the research meeting.

183
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,906
Count Piast, are you all right?

184
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,199
Yes.

185
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,911
Before we begin, I have something to say.

186
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,166
As I'm sure you're all aware,

187
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,294
I don't have much longer to live.

188
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,841
But before I proceed to heaven,

189
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,429
I am determined to complete
our model of the universe.

190
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,560
At present, humankind is content
with Ptolemy's model.

191
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,190
In truth, it presents few problems
for us in our daily lives.

192
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,942
However,

193
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,486
even if the public accepts it,

194
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,740
we cannot give up the pursuit of truth.

195
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,951
And I cannot believe it is the truth.

196
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,290
The pagans had a myth
about a figure named Icarus.

197
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,377
He flew toward the sun
with wings made of wax

198
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,045
and fell to his death.

199
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,131
His mistake

200
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,342
was not that he had
the arrogance to approach the sun.

201
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,888
It was the ignorance of overlooking
his father's warning that wax would melt.

202
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,601
If wax is not enough,
we must build wings of steel

203
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,938
and continue approaching
that truth we call the sun.

204
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,360
What we lack now

205
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,154
is that audacity.

206
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,116
To complete a true model of the universe,

207
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,993
we must become Icarus.

208
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,922
What are you doing over there?

209
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,551
Count Piast!

210
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,970
I, uh... I was only...

211
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,768
Didn't you apply to do research here?

212
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,978
Yes!

213
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,439
I'm honored that you remember me.

214
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,065
Don't take me for a fool.

215
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,027
I hired you and pay your wages.

216
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,823
Why don't you take part in the meetings?

217
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,327
If it's not worth your time,
I'm happy to fire you.

218
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,537
No, uh, that's...

219
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:13,584
The chairman and the others
haven't given me permission.

220
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,336
Because you're a woman?

221
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,963
A victim of prejudice, I see.

222
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,968
Then again, they may be right.

223
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:23,886
What?

224
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,513
I once read a treatise

225
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,099
which stated that demons
often target women for possession.

226
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,644
In addition,

227
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,063
the holy scripture contains passages

228
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,608
that indicate women should
learn quietly, rather than teach.

229
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,486
If that's the case,

230
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,824
it may be fundamentally unsuitable
for women to debate and present ideas.

231
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,202
Is that...

232
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,788
Is that really

233
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,832
the truth?

234
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,752
The holy scripture is the truth.

235
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,548
Yes, of course!

236
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,634
However, we don't know for certain

237
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,887
that we are reading it correctly.

238
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,770
The next time you have
a treatise to present, bring it yourself.

239
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,024
Not to Kolbe. To me.

240
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,819
I won't forgive a tedious work.

241
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,034
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

242
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:29,952
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

243
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,208
Will she really come?

244
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,294
She will. See for yourself.

245
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
What did your master say?

246
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,810
I don't have a master.

247
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,069
Then who wrote this solution?

248
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,155
I did.

249
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,075
Jolenta,

250
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,246
will you assist us?

251
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,624
Yes.

252
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,461
Thank you very much.

253
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,380
- In that case--
- But first, one thing.

254
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,966
I apologize,

255
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,220
but I am not in a position to freely view
materials about the heavens.

256
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,474
I did so without permission
to solve the problem.

257
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,767
Huh?

258
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,354
However, I do work
at an astronomical laboratory,

259
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,358
so I may be able
to introduce you to a collaborator.

260
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,277
Oh, so that's what you're thinking.

261
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,072
Who will you introduce us to then?

262
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,074
Count Piast.

263
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,954
Count Piast?

264
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,499
Don't tell me you work

265
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,751
at <i>that</i> Count Piast's laboratory.

266
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,461
Yes. <i>That</i> one.

267
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,632
- Oczy, let's go.
- What?

268
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,386
Jolenta, please forget
everything we've discussed.

269
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,887
What?

270
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,349
Count Piast has access
to every document imaginable.

271
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,018
There is not a more powerful ally.

272
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,770
Listen to yourself!

273
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,022
If you work there, you know

274
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,025
that he'll never cooperate with us!

275
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,611
What is this all about?

276
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,029
Who is Count Piast?

277
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,701
There's only one Piast
in the world of astronomy.

278
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,538
He's a nobleman

279
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,291
<i>who has devoted his entire life</i>

280
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,961
<i>to perfecting the geocentric model.</i>

281
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,925
Count Piast has 50 years
of detailed observation records.

282
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,929
If you miss this opportunity,
heliocentrism will drift out of reach.

283
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,431
Don't be a fool!

284
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,641
Going to Count Piast is too audacious!

285
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,602
Is it more audacious

286
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,146
than moving the Earth?

287
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,403
It's true that Count Piast believes
in the geocentric model more than anyone.

288
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,656
But even more than that,

289
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,241
he believes in truth.

290
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,455
Fine.

291
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,957
In that case, follow me.

292
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,379
Hey, isn't this dangerous?

293
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,338
Don't worry.

294
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,509
If we're arrested,
I'll say we were deceived by a witch.

295
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,888
By utilizing my knowledge,

296
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,557
we can pin most of the charges on her.

297
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,643
This may even work to our advantage.

298
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:53,072
So you're the ones
who wish to discuss the cosmos?

299
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,490
Yes.

300
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,243
But first, let me say how honored we are--

301
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,621
Forget the stupid flattery!

302
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,207
Get straight to the point.

303
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,835
Recently,

304
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,962
we've been conducting certain research.

305
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,381
One that follows
in Aristarchus's footsteps.

306
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,135
To complete that research,

307
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,388
{\an8}we would like you to loan us
your observation records.

308
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,060
In addition, this man Oczy
possesses excellent eyesight.

309
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,272
You were once famous
for your eyesight too.

310
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,526
If observation is not
as easy as it once was,

311
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,903
you are free to use Oczy at any time.

312
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,030
I can vouch for the accuracy of--

313
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,989
Leave!

314
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,244
Do you have any idea who I am?

315
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:45,415
The model you propose
runs counter to the Church's teachings.

316
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,583
Furthermore,

317
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:52,881
it argues that the research
I've devoted my life to was wrong!

318
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,968
Yes.

319
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,637
But it may be the truth.

320
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,474
Isn't that what you
were really devoted to?

321
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,730
Leave.

322
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,821
We will take our leave for today.

323
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>A child of the house of Piast</i>

324
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,459
<i>wishes to study
the lowly field of astronomy?</i>

325
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,381
Father.

326
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,384
Don't bother coming home.

327
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,388
Do you think you can change history
by gazing at the sky?

328
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,475
You're a disgrace to the family name.

329
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,709
Amazing!

330
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,921
This is the Professor's office.

331
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,300
A gold astrolabe?

332
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,801
This is...

333
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,137
It's a one-of-a-kind piece

334
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,724
that I secretly asked an artisan
to make using pagan knowledge.

335
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,439
You're a member
of the Piast family, aren't you?

336
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,025
In terms of bloodline, I--

337
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,860
We're cousins once removed.

338
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,279
I see. That's rather distant.

339
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,158
I was referred here
after declaring an interest in astronomy.

340
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,788
A worthy reason to visit a family outcast.

341
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,584
Now, tell me one thing.

342
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,629
What do you think is most important

343
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,673
for scholarly advancement?

344
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,176
Audacity.

345
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,639
It's precisely because
scholarly research demands caution

346
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,934
that the first step must be a giant leap.

347
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,312
{\an8}Well said. I like you.

348
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,357
But when it comes to astronomy,

349
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,943
I'm sure everyone opposed you.

350
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,736
Y-Yes.

351
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,490
Let them pinch their useless noses.

352
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,534
They're just spoiled rich folk.

353
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,494
Not true nobility.

354
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,080
But we are different.

355
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,791
We know how to use money appropriately.

356
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,335
What are you researching

357
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,462
in a laboratory this big?

358
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,259
The perfection of the cosmos.

359
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,429
The perfection... of the cosmos?

360
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,391
Our current model contains errors.

361
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,935
Errors in the world God created.

362
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,854
The public may accept it,

363
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,398
but I cannot allow such errors.

364
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,318
That's why I will perfect the model.

365
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,486
I alone will do it.

366
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,073
The massive library of records here

367
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,367
can only be viewed by me.

368
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,370
Eventually, I will reach the truth.

369
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,499
With that in mind,

370
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,002
what is your greatest talent?

371
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,713
What can you contribute to me?

372
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,133
I am able to see great distances.

373
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,509
Oh?

374
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,054
Then show me your observations.

375
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,638
Yes, my lord.

376
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:30,891
This is...

377
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,768
My lord?

378
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,769
{\an8}Good!

379
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,817
I give this gold astrolabe to you.

380
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,862
What? B-But...

381
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,573
Isn't this one of a kind?

382
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:52,120
Superior instruments should be used
by people with superior abilities.

383
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,332
Begin regular observations tomorrow.

384
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,337
Listen, you must not waste
the talent God has given you.

385
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,258
Devote your heart to astronomy.

386
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,097
Then one day, you'll show
those near-sighted fools who doubted you.

387
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,475
By gazing at the sky,

388
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,352
you'll change history.

389
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,440
Show them that you
are the true pride of the family name.

390
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,532
I must perfect the cosmos.

391
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,957
