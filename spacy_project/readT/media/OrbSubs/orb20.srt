1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,755
Take this to the next point.

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,514
It includes Draka's recollection
of the manuscript, type,

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,517
punches, matrices, and hand molds.

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,396
With those, you can recreate
any letters that break.

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,274
What about the book's contents?

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,401
Was she lying?

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,904
No, I believe her.

8
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,156
In that case,

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,492
the girl has served her purpose.

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,037
Shall we dispose of her?

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,124
Right.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,127
I thought of that too,

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,796
but I promised
to loan her the printing press.

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,507
{\an8}Is that safe?

15
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,969
{\an8}We only just met her.
We don't know her background.

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,267
<i>People like her deserve a chance.</i>

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>Support doesn't come easily for them.</i>

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,445
Is that so?

19
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,532
Also, regarding the organization's future...

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,993
I leave it to you.

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,497
This is as far as I go.

22
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,210
You're really willing
to do all that for this book?

23
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,212
Yes.

24
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,464
<i>Enabling this book...</i>

25
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,093
<i>No, enabling books
of all kinds to be published</i>

26
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,346
is what I've dreamed of.

27
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,747
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

28
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,399
Nowak!

29
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,234
{\an8}EPISODE 20
I LOVE HELIOCENTRISM

30
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,152
{\an8}We did it!

31
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,196
{\an8}I asked local craftsmen

32
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,532
{\an8}and gained information
on a suspicious barn where--

33
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,409
{\an8}Muster some troops.

34
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,663
<i>It's time to settle things.</i>

35
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,924
Oh!

36
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,220
- Here you go!
- Huh?

37
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,723
Frei picked up supplies from town.

38
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,266
Make sure to savor it.

39
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,268
Th-Thanks.

40
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,532
- If I may...
- Huh?

41
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,995
Why have you thrown away your life
and your place in heaven

42
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,289
to do all of this?

43
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,045
Death.

44
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,173
I do it so I can accept death.

45
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,804
I had a younger sister once.

46
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,349
At age ten or so,
she collapsed from disease.

47
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,228
Well, I suppose
everyone's got a story like that.

48
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,693
<i>At the end of her young life,
she managed some final words.</i>

49
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>They were very brief.</i>

50
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,864
<i>A quiet, ultimate question.</i>

51
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,619
<i>"Why was I born?"</i>

52
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,706
Here's what I thought.

53
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,749
It's on God's behalf.

54
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,710
It was so she could ascend to heaven.

55
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,547
If humans die, why are they born?

56
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,467
God and religion exist
to answer that question.

57
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,721
{\an8}But I couldn't say it,

58
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,850
{\an8}and she died before I could say anything.

59
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:16,357
Ever since that day,
I've thought about what I would need

60
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,027
to confidently say it's on God's behalf.

61
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,448
What I do now
is the end result of those thoughts.

62
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,786
{\an8}At the very least, it's not God
who persecutes the heretics.

63
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,163
{\an8}It's humans.

64
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,292
{\an8}If no one else is gonna say it, I will.

65
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,630
If I don't, I'll never be able to tell
my sister that it's on behalf of God.

66
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,970
I won't say this in front of the captain,
but religion is important.

67
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,806
{\an8}Without religion,

68
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,642
{\an8}humans could never be this strong.

69
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,022
Even in some far-off place,

70
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,691
there is someone else
who believes in the same God.

71
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,403
That alone is great moral support.

72
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,156
{\an8}But even so,

73
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:09,118
{\an8}a long time has passed
since the Church was founded.

74
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,039
{\an8}It's inevitable that rot sets in.

75
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,043
More and more contradictions emerge,

76
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,879
and you can hear the gears
of change grinding everywhere.

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,092
We're surely living
in a period of transition.

78
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,887
That's why I've tried
to find my mission in life

79
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,764
and carry it out.

80
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,395
I have faith that doing this
will allow me to accept my sister's death.

81
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,980
I don't want to shirk death.

82
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,273
I want to affirm it.

83
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,529
<i>That is my life's theme.</i>

84
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,284
- Oh? Perfect timing.
- Huh?

85
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,837
You know, I'm surprised
you use machines like this.

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,840
Don't you despise technology?

87
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,091
Of course!

88
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,719
I merely use technology
to overcome technology.

89
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,975
What makes you hate
man-made things so much?

90
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,060
It's simple.

91
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,729
In my place of birth,

92
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,732
people killed one another
over their interpretation of God.

93
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,234
My family was killed too.

94
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,573
Things like that are happening all over.

95
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,242
It can't be natural.

96
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,204
The problem must
be dealt with at its roots.

97
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,084
{\an8}All these disasters
are the result of man-made things.

98
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:45,006
{\an8}Man-made society, man-made rules,
and a man-made God.

99
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:54,265
The things humans make
can only ever be ugly imitations.

100
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,602
Looking at the vastness
of nature makes that clear.

101
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,355
We are no match.

102
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,237
Humans can't make something from nothing.

103
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,575
And when they do borrow
the power of nature,

104
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,578
they make carriages,
crossbows, and explosives.

105
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,164
Nothing but ugly weapons.

106
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,041
According to Plato,

107
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,377
the imitations humans make
are merely a form of play.

108
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,963
They are not to be taken seriously.

109
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,383
Only God's creations are real.

110
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,386
To think our technology

111
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,557
reflects an understanding of nature
is a meaningless conceit.

112
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,061
I'll say it again.

113
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,022
I don't believe in human intellect.

114
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,193
Good. This will do.

115
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,779
Thanks for your help.

116
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,406
Yeah? Well then...

117
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,455
<i>Think.</i>

118
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,667
That process is where the truth lies.

119
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,382
- Aristotle said...
- Huh?

120
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,637
Aristotle said that technology
is an imitation of nature too.

121
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,432
But he also said this.

122
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,979
"Technology in some cases completes
what nature cannot bring to a finish."

123
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,779
This fabric and these bloodstained coins

124
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,823
are keepsakes of my father.

125
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,160
When I look at them,
I remember my conviction

126
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,412
and him.

127
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,833
These two things didn't grow naturally.

128
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,335
They were made by human hands.

129
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,713
That doesn't make them worthless.

130
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,549
Imitations made by humans at times

131
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,302
complete what nature
cannot bring to a finish.

132
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,723
Anyway...

133
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,073
Observing the heavens?

134
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,117
Yes.

135
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,329
But since I don't know the exact time,

136
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,080
the records will be useless.

137
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,124
Is that so?

138
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,501
It seems we're about to leave.

139
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,378
I came to say goodbye.

140
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,006
That's awfully polite of you.

141
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,507
Do you have a motive?

142
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,010
O-Of course not!

143
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,638
I'm not that greedy.

144
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,975
Oh, but since you asked,
this hood is rather fine quality...

145
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,895
- Yeah? Then you can have it.
- What?

146
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,648
I won't be using it anymore.

147
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,277
Oh, and there's something else
I want to give to you.

148
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,075
{\an8}A vial? What is it?

149
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,285
{\an8}There's a letter inside.

150
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,789
When the book is published
and distributed,

151
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,415
mail it for me.

152
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,418
What sort of letter?

153
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,421
It's an obligation to my predecessors.

154
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,381
What?

155
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,051
It was written in the book
that you relayed to me, remember?

156
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,680
A portion of the profits
should be set aside.

157
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,266
Then again,
there's no plan for profits just yet.

158
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,686
But why me?

159
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,230
What? Is it a hassle?

160
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,941
You burned something precious to me.

161
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,360
Isn't this the least you can do?

162
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,278
No, that's not what I mean.

163
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,116
Can you trust me with this?

164
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,495
I have nothing to do with your past

165
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,539
and all the history that transpired.

166
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,542
Shouldn't you ask Schmidt and the others?

167
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,045
I might burn this too
at a moment's notice.

168
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,130
So why me?

169
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,133
Because you're young.

170
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,050
What?

171
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,636
I'll put it another way.

172
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,140
Right now, young people like you
are history's protagonists.

173
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,559
That's why I entrust it to you.

174
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,395
Huh? Come on.

175
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,272
You can't drag me into things!

176
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,357
History doesn't concern me--

177
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,608
Yes, it does.

178
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,155
People inherit the discoveries
of their predecessors.

179
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,825
It happens naturally, arbitrarily,
and before you know it.

180
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,371
That's why everyone who lives now
carries the past within them.

181
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,833
{\an8}Why are people so concerned with memory?

182
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,629
{\an8}Why do we interpret individual phenomena
according to linear time?

183
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:42,553
{\an8}Why do our minds compel us
to look into history?

184
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,681
The way I see it,

185
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,184
God has given us a chance to learn.

186
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,352
In other words,

187
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,772
history is an extension of God's will.

188
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,774
God's will?

189
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,193
And what exactly is that?

190
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,069
It's in the Holy Scripture.

191
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,824
"God causes all things
to work together for good."

192
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,285
That is God's will.

193
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,247
God is changing the world
through human acts.

194
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,751
Little by little,
over long periods of time.

195
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,338
The present moment
exists within that great current.

196
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,342
In the end, I think
the meaning of our birth

197
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,804
lies within that plan,
within trial and error.

198
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,015
It's to participate
in the dull, endless task

199
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,850
of crawling toward good.

200
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,814
By accepting and confronting evil,
rather than casting it aside,

201
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,983
we sometimes give birth to a greater good.

202
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,152
It's not that good and evil

203
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,571
exist as two different paths.

204
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,741
Everything is connected
by a single thread.

205
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,743
When I think of it like that,

206
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,539
none of my past hardships
were meaningless.

207
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,501
{\an8}But without history,
humans lose sight of that.

208
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,878
{\an8}They succumb to fear

209
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,548
{\an8}of the finite nature of life.

210
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,092
{\an8}To ascertain history

211
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,054
{\an8}is equivalent to ascertaining
where God is guiding us.

212
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,808
{\an8}That's why we lose our way
when we ignore the past.

213
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,562
That's way too abstract.

214
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,189
For me, it's quite concrete.

215
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,190
How so?

216
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,527
Because awareness of history
influences my decisions.

217
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,822
{\an8}For example...

218
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,950
{\an8}My father was an inquisitor.

219
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,663
I've walked a completely
different path from him.

220
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,875
I don't know what he is doing now.

221
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,461
I don't even know if he is alive.

222
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,382
I doubt I'll ever meet him again,

223
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,551
but sometimes I imagine it.

224
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,763
If I were to confront
my father as I am now,

225
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,432
or if he tried to hinder me,

226
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,975
what would happen?

227
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,397
{\an8}I don't have to think much to know
it would be the worst moment of my life.

228
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,900
{\an8}I'd probably be confused
and lose my composure.

229
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,820
{\an8}But it's that moment, most of all,

230
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,615
{\an8}when I have to make the right decision.

231
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,910
All the misfortunes of my life

232
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,621
have surely existed
for the sake of that moment.

233
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,081
The accumulation of history

234
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,667
will calm my nerves,

235
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,669
crush my fears,

236
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,463
guide my thoughts,

237
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,841
and stop me from running away.

238
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,015
All the winds of human history
will be at my back.

239
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,020
- Why?
- Huh?

240
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,105
Why come up with such twisted reasoning

241
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,982
for the sake of that book?

242
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,155
{\an8}Because I love heliocentrism.

243
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:54,703
And... because I want
to celebrate that love.

244
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,247
That's childish.

245
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,208
I agree.

246
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,251
So overcome it.

247
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,254
Leader!

248
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,927
There are two carriages heading this way.

249
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,679
<i>They're knights.</i>

250
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:13,931
What?

251
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,934
So they've found us already.

252
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,852
It's sooner than I expected.

253
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,649
In that case, please flee
through the rear gate.

254
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,944
When you clear the forest,
there's a carriage waiting.

255
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,614
If all goes well,
you can escape without being noticed.

256
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,200
Head to the destination together.

257
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:38,205
- I'll stay behind and distract them.
- What?!

258
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,040
As the leader of the organization,

259
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,126
I'm the one they're after.

260
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,712
B-But if you distract them,

261
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,296
what happens next?

262
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,924
That's not for you to think about.

263
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:52,970
Bye.

264
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,102
We must get moving too.

265
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,146
I swear... I'll avenge you.

266
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,523
I see them!

267
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:50,903
It's a woman.

268
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,738
It must be their leader!

269
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,034
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

270
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:57,951
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

271
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,791
We are inquisitors from the Church!

272
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,919
I ask you in the name of God!

273
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,923
Are you the leader
of the Heretic Liberation Front?

274
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,092
Indeed.

275
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,177
I'm the leader.

276
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,388
Everyone, prepare to fire!

277
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,447
Huh? E-Explosives?

278
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,535
Don't tell me... she lit them herself?

279
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,252
N-Nowak!

280
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,129
What does this mean?

281
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,883
Just now... for a brief second...

282
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,800
What?

283
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,192
Nowak, this is...

284
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,820
I can't wrap my head around it either.

285
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,572
But what I do know

286
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,241
is that new technology was just used

287
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,912
to do something terrifying,
right before our eyes.

288
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,914
That and...

289
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,210
their leader is dead.

290
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,192
There's smoke from the barn!

291
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,319
Jolenta must have been attacked!

292
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,447
No, she martyred herself.

293
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,950
Mar... What?

294
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,201
Martyred?

295
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,536
This too was part of the plan.

296
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,789
The explosion provides cover

297
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,583
for us to reach
the printing workshop safely.

298
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,672
The enemy's goal was to eliminate
the Heretic Liberation Front's leader.

299
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,423
They've accomplished that.

300
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,884
They'll be short
on information for a while,

301
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,052
so they can't track us.

302
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,265
Plus, since the Reformation
will be handling distribution,

303
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,434
martyrdom is crucial
to earning their cooperation.

304
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,271
They're considered heretics,

305
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,398
but they're still among the faithful.

306
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,360
They'd be hesitant to join with
an organization like ours.

307
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,822
But the leader's death will change that.

308
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,617
To the public, it will look like
the Liberation Front has disbanded.

309
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,663
By casting ourselves
as a new, unrelated organization,

310
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,374
we can approach the Reformation.

311
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,961
Couldn't you have
just pretended to disband?

312
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,548
Making it factual
is the best way to avoid suspicion.

313
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,385
But most of all,
the leader thought of this

314
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,262
and decided herself.

315
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,139
Even if it's a faint hope,

316
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,018
if martyring herself would raise
the book's chances of living on,

317
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,894
she said she'd make that choice.

318
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,317
And you didn't stop her?

319
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,986
Is that sympathy I detect?

320
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,780
Feelings aren't part of our mission.

321
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,533
If they overtake you, you'll misjudge.

322
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,994
For us, death is a daily reality.

323
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,955
The important thing
is where and when one dies.

324
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,792
God's own judgment is behind her judgment.

325
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,546
She experienced an honorable death
for her convictions.

326
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,509
Convictions...

327
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,888
Didn't you say the same?

328
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,434
Those coins you have
represent your conviction to earn money.

329
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,812
That means you'll face it one day too.

330
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,523
The difficulty of maintaining conviction...

331
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,526
{\an8}Conviction comes with a price.

332
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,529
{\an8}If you can't risk your life,
you're all talk.

333
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,365
{\an8}Where we're headed now,

334
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,451
{\an8}there's no room for sympathy.

335
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,536
But that's...

336
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,454
Uh-oh.

337
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,705
Huh?

338
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,832
Everyone, stay calm.

339
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,837
It's the knights.
We're about to cross paths.

340
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,216
Hide the type behind your seat.

341
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,400
You in that carriage! Halt!

342
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,490
Come out, all of you!

343
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,957
