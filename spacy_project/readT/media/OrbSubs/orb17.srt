00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:08,299
{\an8}EPISODE 17: I COULD MAKE A LOT
OF MONEY WITH THIS BOOK... MAYBE

2
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,191
It's not enough.

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,654
This isn't nearly enough
to cure my fear of death.

4
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,764
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

5
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,792
These are from my father?

6
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,962
They're all that could be brought back.

7
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,994
Were you able to draw the map, Draka?

8
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,662
Chief.

9
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,291
Here. It should be accurate.

10
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,169
Oh my, this is amazing.

11
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,837
Thank you, as always.

12
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,298
Now will you hear what I have to say?

13
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,720
You won't take "next time"
for an answer, will you?

14
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:03,057
No, you promised to listen
in exchange for my work.

15
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,060
Very well.

16
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:11,733
There should be more efficient ways
for us to earn money.

17
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,486
At present, we divide
our profits equally among the tribe.

18
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,405
That leads some people to be lazy.

19
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,574
To prevent that,

20
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,577
those who contribute more
should be rewarded.

21
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,996
In fact, they could even get all of it!

22
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,167
If we distribute less, the sense
of urgency will accelerate competition,

23
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,169
and the whole tribe will benefit.

24
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,795
- We can--
- Draka.

25
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,172
Huh?

26
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,467
I am always grateful for your efforts.

27
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,596
No one else thinks as much
about the village's future as you.

28
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,225
And you have such a sharp memory!

29
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,978
You can draw maps
of abandoned villages after one trip.

30
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:56,611
<i>We rely on those maps
to safely retrieve discarded fabrics,</i>

31
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>and our division of labor
transforms them into new products.</i>

32
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,995
Rather than let each person
work on their own,

33
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,790
we can improve efficiency and quality

34
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,459
by assigning specialized tasks.

35
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,420
It was your idea, wasn't it?

36
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:19,092
Thanks to that, we don't have to rely on
risky acts like stealing or hunting.

37
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,095
The village has already benefited plenty.

38
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,139
We're all grateful to you.

39
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,850
Things still aren't efficient enough.

40
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,063
There must be other products or skills
that can be more uniform!

41
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,148
Those are what I want to find!

42
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,566
Draka,

43
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,529
I told you, the village
has already benefited plenty.

44
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,365
We must not be greedy.

45
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,367
Why do we need more than we have?

46
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,455
{\an8}Our profits are a gift from God.

47
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,125
{\an8}It's only natural
that they be shared equally.

48
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,377
{\an8}You must love your neighbor more.

49
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,130
Why?

50
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,633
Because those are God's teachings.

51
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,802
It's not enough.

52
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,138
Huh? What did you say?

53
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,098
You need more money?

54
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,564
You're a contributor.

55
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,859
I'm happy to loan you money
from our treasury at any time.

56
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:22,447
Although I don't know why
you are in such desperate need of it.

57
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,532
For peace of mind.

58
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,327
Peace... of mind?

59
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,995
Forget it. It's nothing.

60
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,955
I don't need the loan.

61
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,665
If you'll excuse me...

62
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,131
Uncle, I brought your dinner.

63
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,966
Oh, it's you, Draka.

64
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,971
Thank you for looking after
this frail old man.

65
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,810
What's that? Did you steal wine again?

66
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,938
Don't say it like that!

67
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,107
These belong to everyone, right?

68
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,736
You mustn't bully me.

69
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,364
My body has fallen prey to disease,

70
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,449
and I'll soon depart this world.

71
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,744
Can't you overlook a minor drinking habit?

72
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,207
You've been saying that for years,
and you haven't died yet.

73
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,459
Well, that's...

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,004
You used to be much more sincere.

75
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,048
How did you end up like this?

76
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,801
Well, putting that aside,

77
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,845
I want to ask your opinion
about something.

78
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,971
What?

79
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,849
If we had individual competition,

80
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,395
I think we could increase profits
for the entire tribe.

81
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,729
How about it?

82
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,651
Well, I suppose it's possible.

83
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,860
In that case--

84
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,113
Even so, I'm against it.

85
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,283
Not because it defies God's teachings,

86
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,453
but because it will destroy our unity.

87
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,792
Our population is too small
for competition.

88
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,254
But that's no reason
to grow bigger either.

89
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,842
It's true that with more people,
we could stimulate competition,

90
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,386
but it also means more disparity.

91
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,847
That will lead to conflict.

92
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,266
Such an idea

93
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,726
offers no salvation for the weak.

94
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,063
Freedom without morals is mere chaos.

95
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,609
So it's a no, huh?

96
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,863
Now, now. There's no need to get upset.

97
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,241
You are intelligent,
and you have a bright future.

98
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,245
So you say, but sometimes I worry.

99
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,998
Could it be that I'm destined

100
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,626
to live my whole life here, as I am?

101
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,879
Don't worry.

102
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,756
You have conviction.

103
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,385
One day, that conviction
will show you the way.

104
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,263
Your time hasn't come yet.

105
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,057
Right. I'll choose to believe that.

106
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,839
Do you always come here to cry?

107
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,426
Uncle...

108
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,470
Come back.

109
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,516
Everyone is worried
because you disappear every morning.

110
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,101
We're a community.
You can't act on your own.

111
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,105
Did they tell you to say that?

112
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,234
I'm your only living relative, after all.

113
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,110
Then you can go home.

114
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,196
I'll be back soon.

115
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,281
I can't allow that.

116
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,159
You'll just do the same thing tomorrow.

117
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,162
Why do you cry when morning comes?

118
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,415
You really don't know?

119
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,335
Because morning is when Father died.

120
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,380
That may be, but why here?

121
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,757
You can cry in your tent.

122
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,552
You don't understand that either?!

123
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,471
Obviously, it's out of concern!

124
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,223
Concern for what?

125
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,849
For everyone!

126
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,894
Everyone says that Father went to heaven.

127
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,816
If they see me cry,
it's like saying God's will was a lie!

128
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,945
I see. I think I understand.

129
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,742
In that case, I'll teach you
three magic spells

130
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,995
that will cure your worries.

131
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,372
However, you can't tell anyone.

132
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,707
Huh?

133
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,876
Doesn't that go against God's teachings?

134
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,129
The first

135
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,548
is that God doesn't exist.

136
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,759
What?

137
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,179
There's actually no evidence God exists.

138
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,057
Well, you could say
that not knowing for sure

139
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,226
is what makes us "believers."

140
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,562
However, not believing in God

141
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,273
is an advantage
because it gives you more choices.

142
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,528
So from now on,
you need not concern yourself with God.

143
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,239
Don't let God take
certain things from you,

144
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,076
such as control of your emotions
and your reason to live.

145
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,456
Instead, believe that your pain
is the world's pain.

146
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,501
Starting tomorrow, don't hesitate
to be sad in front of the others.

147
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,755
If you understand,
I'll move on to the second.

148
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,590
Think.

149
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,885
Learn your letters
and read all the books you can.

150
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,679
Not so you can show off,

151
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,348
but so you can think.

152
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:45,978
Find the connections between
bits of information that seem unrelated.

153
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,857
Transform mere information
into knowledge you can use.

154
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,860
That process is where the truth lies.

155
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,362
The truth?

156
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,905
Yes.

157
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,699
With that, you'll have the courage
to stand your ground

158
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,493
and the will to leap forward.

159
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,997
If you continue thinking
in a world with no God,

160
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,793
then one day, the third spell
will naturally reveal itself.

161
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,461
That's conviction.

162
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,504
Conviction?

163
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,880
Yes.

164
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,967
Conviction will allow you
to conquer your fear and stop crying.

165
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,512
For example, my conviction

166
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,766
is to survive, even if it means
abandoning my convictions.

167
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,144
Isn't that a little weird?

168
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,106
Oh, that's what we call a contradiction.

169
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,275
But what do you expect from a magic spell?

170
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,488
Anyway, if you understand,
stay in your tent starting tomorrow.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,503
God doesn't exist.

172
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,046
Think.

173
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,424
Then you'll gain conviction.

174
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,137
Father died while out plundering.

175
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,431
This money is all he left behind.

176
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,351
<i>Think.</i>

177
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,311
<i>Why did Father die?</i>

178
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,440
<i>What is this money saying to me?</i>

179
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,024
<i>What is it trying to tell me?</i>

180
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,862
<i>Father had to go plundering</i>

181
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,156
<i>because that's how we survive.</i>

182
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,283
<i>If we had more money,</i>

183
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,785
<i>he wouldn't have needed to take that risk.</i>

184
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,746
<i>If we had more money,</i>

185
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,622
<i>Father would still be alive.</i>

186
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,584
<i>Without money, I'll be unhappy.</i>

187
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,085
<i>Without money, I'll be weak.</i>

188
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,796
<i>That's it.</i>

189
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,468
I have to earn money

190
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,095
until the fear is gone from my heart.

191
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,182
That was Father's message.

192
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,350
That's my conviction.

193
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,648
I have to keep thinking

194
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,026
of ways to earn money.

195
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,248
Ah, my moment of bliss.

196
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,375
Huh?

197
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,292
This way.

198
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,045
No one has been here for a long time.

199
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,296
Are you sure it's here?

200
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,090
I'm certain.

201
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,759
On a previous patrol,
we discovered a basement room.

202
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,637
It had a stockpile of fine wine!

203
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,681
I was told to report it to you, Bishop.

204
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,393
Hey, who are you?

205
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,062
Oh, uh, I'm...

206
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,732
From your appearance, you must be a nomad.

207
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,818
This territory belongs to me.

208
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,153
Vulgar scum.

209
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,864
Arrest him!

210
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,699
P-Please wait!

211
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,951
I'll give you all this wine.

212
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,912
I've spent years building this stockpile,

213
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,247
but it's yours!

214
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,250
So please, spare me.

215
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,755
Fine. I'll take it.

216
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,382
Now arrest him.

217
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,343
B-But...

218
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,346
Bishop! We found trespassers outside.

219
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,140
We're in pursuit. There are three!

220
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,601
You bastard. What's your plan?

221
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,312
You've got it wrong. I'm here alone.

222
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,023
I'd be in trouble
if the other villagers knew.

223
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,609
Restrain him.
We'll take him to the hangman.

224
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,610
Wait...

225
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,030
I have no choice.

226
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,573
Huh?

227
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,493
{\an8}Even if you put me in the dungeon,

228
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,288
{\an8}there's no benefit to you, right?

229
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,334
{\an8}I'll give you something
more valuable instead.

230
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,793
What's that?

231
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,339
A young woman.

232
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,050
So please, let me go.

233
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,637
Fine. I accept.

234
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,811
Thank you very much.

235
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,105
This doesn't mean I believe you.

236
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,191
Tell us where the village is.

237
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,195
If you break your promise,
the villagers will face the consequences.

238
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,696
Don't worry.

239
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,949
I promise to bring her to you.

240
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,080
W-We let the intruders escape,

241
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,666
Bishop Antoni...

242
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,544
It's fine. They're not important.

243
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,963
Let them be.

244
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,053
I think this one offers us a lot more.

245
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,932
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

246
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,849
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

247
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,898
Draka, I have something
important to tell you.

248
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,902
For a long time, I've been pondering

249
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,904
whether to entrust you with something.

250
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:34,076
However, my body has grown
weaker than ever lately.

251
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,870
You may not believe me,

252
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,040
but I really think my time is at hand.

253
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,460
And after much thinking,

254
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,005
I've decided to entrust it to you.

255
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,048
What is this about?

256
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,217
I can't tell you the details here.

257
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,803
But I can promise you this.

258
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,390
It's something that will change your fate.

259
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,061
The rest is up to you.

260
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,272
You'll need to prepare yourself.

261
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,649
I'm ready!

262
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,026
Take me there.

263
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,877
They're not here yet?

264
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,423
Okay, wait in that house over there.

265
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,428
I have to wait for the time to come.

266
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,431
Uh... okay.

267
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,229
Blood?

268
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,001
Huh?

269
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,840
A book?

270
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,932
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH
CHAPTER THREE

271
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,102
{\an8}"Heaven and earth are not separate,
hierarchical realms."

272
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,564
"Everything is unified
under a single order."

273
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,820
"Humankind shall be freed
from life in a lowly, corrupt realm."

274
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,990
"Freed by heliocentrism,
the movement of the Earth."

275
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,209
{\an8}W-What the heck is this book?

276
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,962
There's no mistake.

277
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,924
I've just seen something incredible.

278
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,719
Then again...

279
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,849
<i>For such a bold topic,
the writing is pretty simplistic.</i>

280
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,643
<i>Rather than theory,</i>

281
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,480
<i>it focuses on the cultural impact
of heliocentrism.</i>

282
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,943
<i>Most books are either
about religion or academic subjects.</i>

283
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,195
<i>But this one is neither.</i>

284
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,948
<i>It seems to be the author's own thoughts.</i>

285
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:22,077
<i>And it ends by praising God
for creating the Earth.</i>

286
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,080
<i>It's certainly provocative.</i>

287
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,751
<i>But it's not just the content
that excites me.</i>

288
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,382
<i>What I sense right now
is a bigger question.</i>

289
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,342
<i>I can feel it</i>

290
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,386
<i>ever so faintly.</i>

291
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,390
<i>I feel that I could make
a lot of money with this book.</i>

292
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,643
Think.

293
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,774
<i>Let's start from square one.</i>

294
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
<i>To make a lot of money,</i>

295
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,696
<i>a product needs to be widely accepted.</i>

296
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,992
<i>But what does it mean to be accepted?</i>

297
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>Historically, the thing
most accepted by people</i>

298
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,291
<i>is probably God.</i>

299
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,045
<i>So why are people
so willing to accept God?</i>

300
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,549
<i>Most likely it's because...
they're all afraid.</i>

301
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:23,055
<i>Whether it's the future or the afterlife,
people fear the unknown or uncertain.</i>

302
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,890
<i>To find salvation from that,</i>

303
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,352
<i>they turn to God as an absolute,
immovable presence.</i>

304
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>But I remember
what my uncle told me back then.</i>

305
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,025
<i>There is no God.</i>

306
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,736
<i>If that is true,</i>

307
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,573
<i>it's merely that God
is the only choice available.</i>

308
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,535
<i>Could there be an alternative way
to soothe our fears?</i>

309
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,081
<i>Instead of prayers
that may or may not be answered,</i>

310
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:53,210
<i>what if pleasure could be
a more certain way to soothe fear?</i>

311
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:59,091
<i>People surely prefer things
that are easily understood.</i>

312
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,469
<i>One day, we may find excitement
in accessible forms of pleasure.</i>

313
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,721
<i>And if...</i>

314
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,810
<i>If books could be that source...</i>

315
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,398
<i>I could make a lot of money
with this book... maybe.</i>

316
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,279
<i>Plus, right now...</i>

317
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,365
<i>No, ever since I was born,</i>

318
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,202
<i>people have grown suspicious
of the way the Church dominates our lives.</i>

319
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,956
<i>A book that can fundamentally change
the way people think</i>

320
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,583
<i>might be accepted.</i>

321
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,672
<i>The book's content
and the Church's wavering authority...</i>

322
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,341
<i>Those two things are in place. What else?</i>

323
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,678
<i>What do I do about production?</i>

324
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,807
<i>Publish it in manuscript form?</i>

325
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,185
<i>No, that would take
too much time and effort.</i>

326
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,646
<i>I need something else.</i>

327
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,066
<i>Some technique that will ease production.</i>

328
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,860
No, wait.

329
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>In the first place,</i>

330
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>couldn't this book already be famous?</i>

331
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,956
Now that I think about it, it probably is.

332
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,167
It could be that I didn't know of it.

333
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,962
What's gotten into me?

334
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,925
Besides, who wrote this
in the first place?

335
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,261
When was it written?

336
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,347
It doesn't say.

337
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,605
In fact, the absence of names
in the text is almost eerie.

338
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,231
Is it because it's dangerous?

339
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,942
<i>So why does it say this at the end?</i>

340
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,320
<i>"When it becomes safe to do so,</i>

341
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,448
<i>give ten percent
of the profits to Potocki."</i>

342
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,159
They even wrote his address.

343
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,827
Who could he be?

344
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,330
It doesn't seem like he's the author.

345
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,749
Draka! Come here.

346
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,000
Huh?

347
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,919
Uncle! Listen to this!

348
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,004
I found something interesting...

349
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,094
Huh? Who are they?

350
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,054
Is this her?

351
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:09,971
Yes.

352
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,267
You're right. She could draw a good price.

353
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,900
Is this what you meant
by changing my fate?

354
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,403
Forgive me.

355
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,407
I'll do anything to survive.

356
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,957
