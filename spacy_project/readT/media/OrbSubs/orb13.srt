1
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,925
You're not prepared to die, are you?

2
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,178
We're about to find out.

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,803
Well, this is a dilemma.

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,806
You were prepared to die after all.

5
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,309
Yes! I guess so!

6
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,810
It's probably because

7
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,063
the fear of death is nothing

8
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,817
compared to the fear
of placing hope in this world!

9
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,930
I thought I was gonna die.

10
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,224
Sorry, we're late! Are you all right?

11
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,564
He's still breathing.

12
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,317
Get him to a doctor immediately.

13
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,820
{\an8}We need to interrogate him.

14
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,863
{\an8}Don't let him die no matter what.

15
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,770
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

16
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,637
{\an8}EPISODE 13
FREEDOM

17
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,392
What are you doing, Oczy?

18
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,228
What?

19
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,812
Class is over.

20
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:52,941
Huh?

21
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,235
This is...

22
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,196
What am I doing here?

23
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,742
Was my class so boring
that you've forgotten it already?

24
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,911
Huh? No, uh...

25
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,832
What is it? You're acting strange.

26
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,419
Somehow,

27
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,673
I feel as if I've been having

28
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,425
a strange dream.

29
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,303
What sort of dream?

30
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,101
I was researching something.

31
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,938
Something dangerous.

32
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,482
- Heliocentrism, maybe?
- Huh?

33
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,192
How did you know?

34
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,279
That's the subject
of your research, isn't it?

35
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,865
But that can't be made public!

36
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,994
If you don't make it public,

37
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,454
how can anyone debate it?

38
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,502
Shall we talk outside?

39
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,977
What is this place?

40
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,396
Don't be silly.

41
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,522
It's the tower!

42
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,695
Soon, we'll reach the heavens.

43
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,741
You know,

44
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:29,829
I still have trouble believing
that this earth we stand upon is round.

45
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
When the tower is finished,

46
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,501
we'll look down on the Earth
with our own eyes.

47
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,506
Its shape, its color,

48
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,593
even its size...

49
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,262
We'll perceive it all.

50
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,350
What could be more exciting?

51
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,936
Is it okay to build something like this?

52
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,857
Whether it's okay or not,

53
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,194
there's no way to stop it.

54
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,528
Huh?

55
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,204
Why did you choose to study heliocentrism?

56
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,292
I think it was because

57
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,170
I wanted to have hope in this world.

58
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,505
Oh?

59
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,467
So that's how you've perceived it.

60
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:29,430
However, that's just
the superficial reason you created.

61
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,226
In truth,

62
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,646
you're pursuing a grander ideal.

63
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,731
No, you're driven by it.

64
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,861
One could say that
you're a servant of that ideal.

65
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,200
Then again, you yourself

66
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,619
are not mindful of that ideal.

67
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,498
You believe it to be
something you'll never have.

68
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,834
Still,

69
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,379
humans naturally long for it.

70
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:05,091
We are built to desire such a thing.

71
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,176
And that desire

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,846
is one of the few things about humans

73
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,599
that I believe is worthy of respect.

74
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,146
What are you trying to say?

75
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,273
What grand ideal?

76
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,109
What is driving me?

77
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,365
The only one who can answer that is you.

78
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,283
Huh?

79
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,828
There is something you've longed for

80
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,913
from the bottom of your heart.

81
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,499
It's time you realized it.

82
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,435
What a surprise!

83
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,061
You really woke up.

84
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,274
Be grateful to the doctor.

85
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,526
He saved your life.

86
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,530
You probably survived
because of the soup he fed you.

87
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,282
Huh?

88
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,410
Where am I?

89
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,122
I guess the confusion is natural.

90
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,084
This is the medical area
inside the inquisition chamber.

91
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,463
You've been sleeping here for a week.

92
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,550
A week?

93
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,221
You have one strong will to live.

94
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,849
Although the medicine surely helped.

95
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,852
- Why?
- Huh?

96
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,022
Why did you keep me alive?

97
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,317
You'll only kill me later.

98
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,740
You've got the wrong idea.
My job is to get you to talk.

99
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,159
You're only good to me alive.

100
00:08:55,993 --> 00:09:00,206
You may be sentenced to death,
but it's not our job to carry it out.

101
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,918
You won't die while my work is underway.

102
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,674
But of course, you will die afterward.

103
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,717
You're no mere heretic.

104
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,054
You committed an armed assault against us.

105
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,939
Could you leave the two of us alone?

106
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,148
Very well.

107
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,080
Say...

108
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,209
This is a personal question.

109
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,588
There's something on my mind,

110
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,840
and I'd like to ask before we begin.

111
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,844
It's always been a mystery to me.

112
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,265
{\an8}Why do heretics keep appearing?

113
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,853
I mean, it makes no sense.

114
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,398
God made us a promise.

115
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,111
If we live a good and quiet life,
we can go to heaven.

116
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,365
Why would you deliberately give that up?

117
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,956
I could understand
if the devil has driven you mad.

118
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,126
But having spoken with heretics,

119
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,545
I know it's not that simple.

120
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,881
Some of them are of sound mind.

121
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,343
What were you thinking?

122
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,678
What motivates you?

123
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,349
If demonic possession isn't the reason,

124
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,934
why do you heretics exist?

125
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,982
I couldn't tell you.

126
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,738
But... in my case,

127
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,658
I think it's because

128
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,702
I made the mistake

129
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,247
of longing for and seeking something.

130
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,043
What did you seek?

131
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,838
What grand ideal?

132
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,591
What is driving me?

133
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,597
The only one who can answer that is you.

134
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,768
Freedom.

135
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,859
I guess I'll never understand.

136
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,737
"Freedom" sounds good and all,

137
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,616
but without a code of law,
we're no different from beasts.

138
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,870
Yes. You may be right.

139
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,832
But if we can't question that code,

140
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,001
that's no different from beasts either.

141
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,797
Doesn't common sense tell you
that you've gone too far?

142
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:59,677
Just because you believe that
the sun is the center of the universe,

143
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,887
you killed three of my men.

144
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,515
Talk about blind faith.

145
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,018
I tried to avoid their vital spots.

146
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,645
They died, did they?

147
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,982
We each fought for our convictions.

148
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,276
They must have been ready.

149
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,612
Well, either way...

150
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,617
There's nothing more for me to say.

151
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,537
Because I don't know anything.

152
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,053
- Excuse me!
- Huh?

153
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,060
Um, can I ask what you've done
with the stone chest since then?

154
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,485
I've finished my book,
and I'd hoped to store it in there.

155
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,238
I threw the stone chest down a ravine

156
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,241
and burned all the documents inside.

157
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,579
We have Count Piast's
perfect observation records anyway.

158
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,748
That chest is useless now.

159
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,167
So you finished your book?

160
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,960
Show it to me.

161
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,046
R-Right.

162
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,218
It may be finished,
but I'm sure there are mistakes.

163
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,844
If you have any advice...

164
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,347
Huh?

165
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,307
Wait, what?!

166
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,560
Hey!

167
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,312
How could you do that?

168
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,648
I could ask <i>you</i> the same thing.

169
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,942
It's too dangerous to leave this.

170
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,361
I told you I would burn it.

171
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,946
In fact,

172
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,450
I think you should be grateful
that I overlooked this until now.

173
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,746
All evidence should obviously be burned.

174
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,668
I have a simple question.

175
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,840
If we do happen to be caught,

176
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,593
they might torture us
until we hand over our materials.

177
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,972
If all the evidence is destroyed,

178
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,225
we won't have anything
to hand over, right?

179
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,187
Even if we tell the truth

180
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,190
and say that we burned all the evidence,

181
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,985
will they believe us?

182
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,821
We can't prove that everything is gone,

183
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,115
so the torture will continue.

184
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,576
What do we do then?

185
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,077
That's obvious.

186
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,876
We simply accept
the nightmare that confronts us.

187
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,093
Um, are we finished?

188
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,804
I really don't know a thing.

189
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,017
Do you know the essence of torture?

190
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,936
It's simple, really.

191
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,900
You weigh bargaining chips on a scale
with the target's convictions.

192
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,572
Most of the time, that means weighing
their desire to not reveal information

193
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:12,161
against the bargaining chip
of ending the pain by disclosing it.

194
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,165
That gets most people to talk.

195
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,670
But sometimes, you get someone strange.

196
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:27,217
I don't know if they have a death wish
or they've simply lost their senses,

197
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,678
but they withstand the pain.

198
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,016
Normal methods of torture
don't work against those people.

199
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:39,521
In those cases, you need
more effective bargaining chips.

200
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,358
For example, the threat of inflicting pain

201
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,904
on their family, friends,
or collaborators.

202
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,450
I can't tell you what I don't know.

203
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,953
No matter what chips you use.

204
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,706
You don't get it.

205
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,917
<i>You're</i> the bargaining chip.

206
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,834
Huh?

207
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,507
Bring him in.

208
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,896
He'll tell us what we need to know.

209
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,065
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

210
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:23,983
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

211
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,738
Now then...

212
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,412
All the players are here.

213
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,288
Remove the blindfold.

214
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,550
H-How did...

215
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,096
You didn't seriously think
he would get away?

216
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,849
He's one of us after all.

217
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,226
As you've probably noticed by now,

218
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,147
in this world,
enemies of the one true church

219
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,691
have nowhere to run.

220
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,653
Now then, let's get started.

221
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,822
Badeni,

222
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,993
please do us the favor
of answering honestly.

223
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,620
Otherwise, there will be suffering.

224
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,253
Do you commune with the devil?

225
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,255
No.

226
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,011
Oh, is that so?

227
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,651
Have you ever attended a black mass?

228
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,695
No.

229
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,746
The next question is an important one.

230
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,832
With regard to your research,

231
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,044
do you have collaborators?

232
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,264
<i>If we're arrested,
I'll say we were deceived by a witch.</i>

233
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,565
None.

234
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,569
I see.

235
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,992
Okay, I'd say we're warmed up now.

236
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,081
To be honest, those questions
were the ones I was required to ask.

237
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:49,461
What I really want you to answer
is the next one.

238
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,589
What is it you want to know?

239
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,387
Before I get to that,

240
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,597
I owe you both thanks.

241
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,769
I'm embarrassed to say it,

242
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,439
but because of you,
I've become aware of my mistakes,

243
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,859
and I'm ready to correct them.

244
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,196
I've been negligent
in dealing with you people.

245
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,868
And it's not that I've lacked
opportunities to change.

246
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,080
In fact, I had a glaringly obvious chance.

247
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,499
It was just too strange to process.

248
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:33,839
Instead, I turned away, forgot about it,
and avoided making changes.

249
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,593
Because of that error,

250
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,680
I allowed you heretics
to commit the barbaric act

251
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,515
of approaching my beloved daughter.

252
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,020
I had opportunities to stop you.

253
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,440
<i>Ten years ago,</i>

254
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,484
<i>I was assigned the case
of a certain heretic.</i>

255
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,785
That necklace you have belonged to him.

256
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
I don't know how,

257
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,127
but it crossed time and space
to enter your hands.

258
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,880
Ten years ago,

259
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:20,093
if I had been more diligent in my work,
I could have prevented all of this.

260
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,016
As a parent, there is no greater shame.

261
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,437
So again, I thank you both.

262
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,190
My eyes are finally open.

263
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,444
Now to the point.

264
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,448
You two inherited
that research from somewhere.

265
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,953
That means the materials
still exist somewhere now.

266
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,290
We can't prove that everything is gone,

267
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,251
so the torture will continue.

268
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,128
What do we do then?

269
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
That's obvious.

270
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,677
We simply accept
the nightmare that confronts us.

271
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,183
Well? Answer me.

272
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,690
It's true that we inherited the research.

273
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,401
- Then tell me--
- However...

274
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,488
You seem to be operating
from a fundamental misunderstanding.

275
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,075
I have no interest
in honoring my predecessors

276
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,661
or passing on the fruits of my research.

277
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,414
I only did it

278
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,500
so that I could become special.

279
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,253
I hate to tell you,

280
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,548
but I burned all the old materials.

281
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,718
The treatise you confiscated
during my arrest

282
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,054
is all that is left
of the heliocentric theory.

283
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,351
I don't mean to pour cold water
on your ten-year endeavor,

284
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,729
but the case is solved.

285
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,149
You have no role to play.

286
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,029
That's why torturing Oczy
is a waste of time.

287
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,867
Now that's an anticlimactic reply.

288
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,495
Yes. But it's the truth.

289
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,999
Moving on, what I'd like to discuss

290
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,252
is whether heliocentrism
really is blasphemy--

291
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,924
My, my.

292
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,511
You must really take us for fools.

293
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:32,017
I may have been negligent,
but I've still been working every day.

294
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,853
And in doing so, I've learned

295
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,274
how to spot the face of a liar.

296
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:45,155
Were there any
logical inconsistencies in what I said?

297
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,583
Your story makes sense.

298
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,420
But what I focus on is emotions.

299
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,424
They reveal truth more than reason does.

300
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,763
And the emotions
my eyes perceived from you

301
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,933
tell me that you're hiding something.

302
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,686
That's baseless speculation.

303
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,940
{\an8}If that's the case...

304
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,825
let's find the basis.

305
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,957
