1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,672
Hey, you two.

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,300
Hello there.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,721
I'm Nowak. I'll be training you.

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,264
Pleased to meet you.

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,726
Th-The pleasure is ours.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,812
Nervous, huh?

7
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,731
I get it.

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,692
Our work is socially necessary,

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,653
but dealing with heretics,
let alone torturing them,

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,572
certainly isn't pleasant.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,827
I haven't even told my daughter
what I really do.

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,039
But don't worry.

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,041
You'll get used to it.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:47,505
Anyway, the thing
you should be most prepared for

15
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,882
is this.

16
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,968
Any idea what this could be?

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,762
- Uh...
- No.

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,642
This is the amount of paperwork required
to close even one heretic's case.

19
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,147
{\an8}In other words,
this work can be a real pain.

20
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,151
But then, what you really want to know

21
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,488
is how to move up
the ladder efficiently, right?

22
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,405
Huh?

23
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,117
{\an8}Here's how I approach things.

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,080
{\an8}The Bishop is especially concerned
with theories of the cosmos.

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,794
{\an8}If you volunteer for a case like that,
you'll earn points with him.

26
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:30,548
Also, rather than spending
lots of time on a major target,

27
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,301
take care of smaller ones
in large numbers.

28
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,805
Greater numbers
will earn you a good reputation.

29
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,432
Any questions?

30
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,894
U-Um,

31
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,147
why is the Bishop
concerned with the cosmos?

32
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,941
Oh...

33
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,943
Well, you see,

34
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,237
the Bishop once studied astronomy.

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,154
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

36
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,407
Despite that,
he's practically allergic to it now.

37
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,870
When that happens,
it usually points to trouble long ago.

38
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,998
Your young experiences
tend to stick with you.

39
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,543
Any more questions?

40
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,422
In that case, we'll continue
in the inquisition chamber.

41
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:12,882
Let's go.

42
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,595
Oh, hello there, Antoni.

43
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,348
I thought I heard a racket.

44
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,308
What are you inquisitors doing here?

45
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,018
Well...

46
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,313
The Bishop wanted to encourage
the new recruits.

47
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,815
Recruits?

48
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,733
Give me a break.

49
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,737
You inquisitors are costing us
enough money already.

50
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,573
Now you're hiring new recruits?

51
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,411
Now, now. A clergyman
needn't fret over money, right?

52
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,496
Ignorant as always.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,081
Listen to me.

54
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,126
Whether it's fighting holy wars
or maintaining the Church,

55
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,752
they both require money.

56
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,089
It's time you learned
what money is really worth.

57
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,302
I don't know how you earned
the Bishop's favor,

58
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,388
but an inquisitor should know his place.

59
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,393
Gotcha.

60
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,270
Will do.

61
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,440
The Bishop's stupidity knows no bounds.

62
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,905
Who was that?

63
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:21,409
He's a curate, maybe?

64
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,661
I don't know his official title.

65
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,624
To put it more simply,
he's the Bishop's son.

66
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,543
His son? Isn't he celibate?

67
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,254
Of course he is.

68
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,672
In public anyway.

69
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,138
Now then, let's change gears
and head to the inquisition chamber.

TERROR

72
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,734
{\an8}Oh, that's right.

73
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,778
{\an8}Before we go in, I have a question.

74
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,406
Have either of you
ever talked to a heretic?

75
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,908
N-No.

76
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,952
Of course not.

77
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,412
That figures.

78
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,541
Well, there's just one thing
to be careful of.

79
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,669
They're skillful liars.

80
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,588
Don't be fooled.

81
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,098
A w-woman?

82
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,727
Yes.

83
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,313
A lot of them are, you know.

84
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,567
She was only arrested yesterday.

85
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,154
She says she knows nothing
about the black mass.

86
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,991
But we got tips from multiple sources,

87
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,327
so we have to investigate thoroughly.

88
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,247
Your task for today

89
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,333
is to learn the basics.

90
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,335
The thumb screw.

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,343
Wakey-wakey.

92
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,434
Good morning.

93
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,855
As I asked you yesterday,
please tell us about the black mass.

94
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,484
{\an8}I also need you to reveal
your collaborators.

95
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,404
I've told you again and again!

96
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,489
I don't know anything!

97
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,368
Put this around her thumb.

98
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,285
Huh?

99
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,465
H-Hey!

100
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,511
So, do you have anything to say now?

101
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,638
I told you. I don't know anything!

102
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,475
- Turn it.
- Huh?

103
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,273
Now.

104
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:37,123
We know you went
in and out of those woods.

105
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,668
Who told you about that place?

106
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,670
You must have a collaborator.

107
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,300
Don't you want this to be over
as much as me?

108
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,386
I told you...

109
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,431
I was only out foraging,

110
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,058
and I ended up in those woods.

111
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,435
You leave me no choice.

112
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,895
Turn it again.

113
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,148
B-But any further and--

114
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,524
Do it.

115
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,944
That's what our instructions call for.

116
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,407
We can't close the case otherwise.

117
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,555
Okay, you can take it off.

118
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,559
You're next.

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,312
There's still the left hand.

120
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,820
Please... stop this.

121
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,907
Then talk.

122
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,620
There's no way you arrived
at those woods by chance.

123
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,997
- Someone told you.
- Why?

124
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,250
Why is this happening to me?

125
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,418
Turn it.

126
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,381
What if she really doesn't know anything?

127
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,509
Do it.

128
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,311
G-God, please.

129
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,113
I can't.

130
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,032
Oh? I see.

131
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,578
That's understandable.

132
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,373
You did well.

133
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,294
In that case, back to you.

134
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,046
Hurry up.

135
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,887
P-Please stop!

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,930
I'll talk!

137
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,932
{\an8}My neighbor Anna told me!

138
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,184
{\an8}My younger brother is ill,

139
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,688
{\an8}and she said I could get herbs
at the black mass.

140
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:11,527
I'm not... a witch.

141
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,447
I only wanted medicine.

142
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,325
I never thought this would happen.

143
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,705
I'm sorry, Anna.

144
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,460
- Please forgive me.
- Thank you for the information.

145
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,921
Okay, let's take a break.

146
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,968
I'm very sorry for what I did.

147
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,970
It's fine.

148
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,723
I get why it's hard. It's your first day.

149
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,645
Still, if you want to finish work early,
you'll need a change of heart.

150
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,483
But is this really the right way?

151
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,902
They might lie

152
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,737
to escape the pain.

153
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,490
Couldn't we try dialog a bit more?

154
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,909
- God's love can--
- The answer is no.

155
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,041
Listen.

156
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,753
We have no authority in the first place.

157
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,255
Our role is to do as we're told.

158
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,759
Plus, if there's one thing I've learned,

159
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,804
it's that heretics
will do whatever it takes.

160
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:24,308
They have a pact with the devil
to change the world.

161
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,396
Do you know what's most important

162
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:33,526
to prevent that and maintain
the world we have now?

167
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,216
You've received
an emergency dispatch order!

168
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,884
A tip came in.

169
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,263
What? Why do I have to go?

170
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,932
I'm in the middle
of training these recruits.

171
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,269
You were named personally by the Bishop.

172
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,816
Then I guess I have no choice.

173
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,236
You'll have to hear the rest
from someone else.

174
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,655
See you around.

175
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,825
What is it this time? The cosmos again?

176
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,160
So it seems.

177
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,707
Forgive me.

178
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,418
You had to torture her in my place.

179
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,381
Well, you do owe me one.

180
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,010
Right. Thanks.

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,345
That man...

182
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,556
He wasn't fazed at all.

183
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:52,062
If we do this long enough,
will we get used to it like him?

184
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,523
Who knows.

185
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,735
Either way, we have to go on.

186
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,696
For the sake of

187
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,866
humankind.

188
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,458
Huh?

189
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,793
It's me, Oczy!

190
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,878
It's almost the appointed time.

191
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,088
We should begin heading toward town!

192
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,342
Got it! I just need to write this letter.

193
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,845
Well, it can wait.

194
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,389
I'll do it later.

195
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,530
It's been a while!

196
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,616
Yes, it has, Jolenta.

197
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,034
Hello.

198
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,955
- Well then... Cheers!
- Cheers!

199
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,173
By the way,

200
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,718
if I may ask,

201
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,514
have you made progress?

202
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,182
Yes.

203
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,520
That's why I called you both here today.

204
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,107
It's finished.

205
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,071
You mean it?

206
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,948
Well, to be precise,

207
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:31,078
it's developed to the point
where I don't mind making it public.

208
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,375
Then that means even now...

209
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,710
Yes.

210
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,712
Right now...

211
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,256
as we speak...

212
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,050
in this very moment...

213
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,275
we're moving.

214
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,909
Still, it's strange

215
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:15,164
to think that we're the only ones
who know the truth.

216
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:20,252
Yeah, I can barely believe it.

217
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,213
- Neither can I.
- Huh?

218
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:28,260
While the mathematical explanation
of planetary orbits is complete,

219
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,222
there is much left to explain
in terms of natural philosophy.

220
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,934
Addressing those puzzles is next.

221
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,227
About that.

222
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,688
What will you do from now on?

223
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,442
Once I complete my final preparations,

224
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,487
I'll head to a republic in the southwest.

225
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,157
I've heard they have
more freedom to research there.

226
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,785
Besides,

227
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,872
the Abbot from the Central Abbey
is spreading bad rumors about me.

228
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,500
I'll give up the cloth
and hide among the secular.

229
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,087
I have no further need
for the clergy anyway.

230
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,384
To support myself, I'll work as a tutor

231
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,095
for nobles or the wealthy
interested in academics.

232
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,180
Once that groundwork is laid,

233
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,265
I'll look for a chance to publish.

234
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,185
So you're leaving the village then?

235
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,687
Yes.

236
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,230
Did you know that, Oczy?

237
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,774
Yes.

238
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,901
Though he only told me recently.

239
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,488
Once Badeni leaves,

240
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,366
I'm planning to go to another city.

241
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,701
A city?

242
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,119
Yes.

243
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,204
I'll find work somewhere

244
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,665
and save money for a few years.

245
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,168
Eventually, I'm thinking
of going to university.

246
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,920
- What?
- What?

247
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,881
I've developed an interest.

248
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,510
I have no set plans for the future.

249
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,721
- I thought I'd give it a try.
- Seriously?

250
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,516
I think it's a wonderful goal!

251
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,809
Please do your best!

252
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,063
And you, Jolenta? What about your future?

253
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,943
My superior Kolbe was promoted,

254
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,364
and he recruited me to join
the new astronomy research team.

255
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,826
I'll work there for the time being.

256
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,746
Eventually,

257
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:23,083
I'd like to publish a treatise
in my own name.

258
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,002
Your own name?

259
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:25,919
Yes.

260
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,338
Right now, I can't mention my name at all.

261
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:34,011
But if I can create a precedent,
it might be easier for those after me.

262
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,347
Someday, there may be a future

263
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,935
and an environment
where everyone is equally free to study.

264
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,937
If I could help build that...

265
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,858
Oh, but that's just a dream for now.

266
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:49,860
A dream?

267
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,617
Oh, uh... my guild mentor used to say

268
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,703
<i>that it's good to have dreams.</i>

269
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,419
<i>These days, I feel like
I finally understand what he meant.</i>

270
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,050
As long as I have a dream,

271
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,221
I feel like I can survive
a week's worth of tragedy.

272
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,724
That's definitely valuable.

273
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,811
Yes, I agree.

274
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,146
Oh, that reminds me.

275
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,651
What happened to the book
you've been writing, Oczy?

276
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,655
Actually, I finished it a short while ago.

277
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,825
Really? I'd love to read it!

278
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,662
Oh, but it's not meant for an audience.

279
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,415
I only wrote it to organize my thoughts.

280
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,458
That won't do.

281
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,254
When you put something in words,
it's a shame not to share it!

282
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,381
Hello there, Jolenta.

283
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,845
Huh?! What are you doing here?

284
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,559
I was in the area for work,
so I thought I'd surprise you.

285
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,728
I asked your coworkers where to find you.

286
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,565
Is that so?

287
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,316
You surprised me.

288
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,694
Oh, excuse me, everyone.

289
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,155
I didn't mean to interrupt.

290
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,783
Sorry. I'll introduce you.

291
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,536
This is my father.

292
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,666
Hello. I'm Jolenta's father, Nowak.

293
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,544
Forgive me, but may I sit down?

294
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,296
Of course. Go ahead.

295
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,598
B-By the way,

296
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,351
what sort of work do you do, sir?

297
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,478
That's, uh...

298
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,566
Let's just say I help the Church.

299
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,320
As you can see,
he never tells me the details.

300
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,115
When a man's with his family,
he wants to forget about work.

301
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,242
You don't have to hold back.

302
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,870
After all, you're serving God, right?

303
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,080
Let's just say it's complicated.

304
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,710
I-Is that so?

305
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,965
If I may...

306
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,344
How do you two know my daughter?

307
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:26,225
You don't seem to be associated
with Count Piast's laboratory.

308
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,561
That's, uh...

309
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:34,024
As you can tell from my appearance,
we work at the village church.

310
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,027
In that case, you probably
shouldn't drink too much!

311
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,450
We also conduct research
into astronomy and astrology on the side.

312
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,994
Research?

313
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,538
A short time ago,

314
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,500
we met your daughter
at the town bulletin board.

315
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,044
She's very well-informed,

316
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,881
so we meet once in a while
to exchange knowledge.

317
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,133
Oh?

318
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,975
How magnificent!

319
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,143
I'm so moved, I was at a loss for words.

320
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,395
Huh?

321
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,274
You're a clergyman and a scholar too?
You must be quite diligent.

322
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,278
I'm embarrassed to say so,
but I have a bit of a lazy streak.

323
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,529
Not at all.

324
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,782
My diligence is nothing
compared to your daughter's.

325
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,909
She's a clearheaded and wise person.

326
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,619
Huh?

327
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,912
Well...

328
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,914
Thank you very much!

329
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:35,168
To be honest, hearing those words
is one of the happiest moments of my life.

330
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,921
Come on, don't be melodramatic.
It's embarrassing.

331
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,924
Can't a father be happy
when his daughter is praised?

332
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,844
A little more humility wouldn't hurt.

333
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,934
Well then, this is where we part.

334
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,937
I apologize for his sudden appearance.

335
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,647
Not at all.

336
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,274
Let's meet again sometime.

337
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,580
Huh?

338
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,915
We...

339
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,043
We're safe!

340
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,254
What's the matter with you?

341
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,006
You've been acting strange.

342
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,550
Is this another weird commoner thing?

343
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,761
It's nothing like that!

344
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,929
Just now,

345
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,016
I was in the greatest danger of my life!

346
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:31,933
What?

347
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,020
Not long ago,

348
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:39,024
<i>I met Jolenta's father somewhere.</i>

349
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,949
And if my memory is correct, he's--

350
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,620
Do you two have a moment?

351
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,798
Hello there.

352
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,967
Didn't you leave with Jolenta?

353
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,346
I sent my daughter back alone.

354
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,224
I still have work to do.

355
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,351
Work?

356
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,940
The truth is

357
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,484
I'm an inquisitor.

358
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,957
