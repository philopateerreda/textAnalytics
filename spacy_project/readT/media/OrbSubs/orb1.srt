1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,215
<i>To obtain bread, one offers coin.</i>

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,387
<i>To obtain rights, one offers taxes.</i>

3
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>To obtain wages, one offers labor.</i>

4
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>So then,</i>

5
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,864
<i>what must one offer up</i>

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,575
<i>to obtain the truth of our world?</i>

7
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,704
ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

{\an8}EARLY 15TH CENTURY
SOMEWHERE IN THE KINGDOM OF P

9
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,727
Three for Wojcik.

10
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,939
Two for Mazur.

11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,525
For Bolanski...

12
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,360
Four.

13
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,241
I only realized it
after assuming this line of work,

14
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,784
but do you know

15
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:01,121
what troubles people the most
when their nails are removed?

16
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,419
They... They can't hold objects.

17
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,297
Without nails, we have no grip.

18
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh, my!

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,677
An answer befitting a scholar.

20
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,762
{\an8}However, it's incorrect.

21
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,933
The answer is pain.

22
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:26,563
It's the simplest things
that seem to trouble people the most.

23
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,449
Now then,

24
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,246
you've hidden research materials
that blaspheme against Church doctrine.

25
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,206
Where are they?

26
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,211
Where?

27
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,306
Where are the materials?

28
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,309
You...

29
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,979
You bastards have no power over the truth!

30
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,064
Oh, dear.

31
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,318
Are you by chance a strong-willed fellow?

32
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,570
What a bother.

33
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,947
This could take a while.

34
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,575
I'd like to go home early.

35
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,995
{\an8}I only have ten nails.

36
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,080
{\an8}Just get it over with!

37
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,053
For Negri... 68.

38
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,638
What?

39
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,515
Nails grow back, you know.

40
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,065
Okay, everyone. I have a question.

41
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,777
What lies at the center of the universe?

42
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,862
Sir! I know!

43
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,988
Oh!

44
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,740
Go on, Kochanski.

45
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,243
It's love!

46
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,747
The center of the universe
overflows with God's love.

47
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,458
That is correct.

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,419
But it's a little too abstract.

49
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,256
Anyone else... Oh!

50
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,840
Rafal, go ahead!

51
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,175
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,515
The center of the universe
is the Earth, of course.

53
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,685
<i>We know this for many reasons.</i>

54
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,603
<i>As Aristotle pointed out,</i>

55
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,772
<i>heavy objects fall downward.</i>

56
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,777
Objects fall to the ground

57
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,407
because the Earth is the lowest sphere
in the center of the universe.

58
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,200
Exactly!

59
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,663
You honor me, my son.

60
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,666
The honor is mine, Professor Potocki.

61
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,585
Come on, are you two bragging?

62
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,380
No, not at all.

63
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,674
The bragging begins now.

64
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:04,637
Big news! Rafal is going to university!

65
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,014
- What?!
- What?!

66
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,392
These days, only a handful of people
can enter university,

67
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,479
but to do so at age 12 is truly amazing.

68
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,981
It calls for celebration!

69
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,359
- Wow!
- That's awesome!

70
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:23,448
Rafal, have you thought
of an appropriate field of study?

71
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,532
Mathematics?

72
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,658
Medicine?

73
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,701
Geography?

74
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,831
Of course, I want to study theology.

75
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,543
As we all know,

76
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,047
theology is the highest academic field.

77
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,924
We owe our lives to God.

78
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,845
A theologist analyzes
the holy scripture logically

79
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,265
so that we may deepen our faith.

80
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,062
I don't believe I have
more talent than anyone else.

81
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,314
I am merely lucky.

82
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,568
That's why I want
to repay that good fortune

83
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,821
by choosing a field
that will be useful to the faithful.

84
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,282
Magnificent!

85
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,242
You are an example to us all!

86
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,204
Oh, stop.

87
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,750
<i>This world</i>

88
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,126
<i>is so easy!</i>

89
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,300
<i>Though it pains me to say it,</i>

90
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,219
<i>the world is full of fools.</i>

91
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,098
<i>I myself was born an orphan,</i>

92
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,143
<i>so I've had my share of poverty,
misery, pity, vulnerability,</i>

93
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,978
<i>and every other disadvantage.</i>

94
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,024
<i>But above all that,
I'm good at living smart.</i>

95
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,276
<i>Really good.</i>

96
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,947
<i>My philosophy</i>

97
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,615
<i>is to live rationally.</i>

98
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,077
<i>If one ignores
irrational emotions like love,</i>

99
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,162
<i>avoids wasteful desires,</i>

100
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,500
<i>and makes reasonable decisions,
one can live comfortably.</i>

101
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,839
<i>That which is rational</i>

102
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,799
<i>is always beautiful.</i>

103
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,469
<i>By sticking to that belief,</i>

104
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,974
<i>people now see me as dignified,
wise, humble, and capable.</i>

105
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,439
University? That's awesome, Rafal!

106
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,065
I can brag about knowing you!

107
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,192
No, I'm nothing special.

108
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>Simpletons like this guy Kochanski</i>

109
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,867
<i>respect me right away,
so they're good to have around.</i>

110
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,660
You're a genius.

111
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,829
Not at all.

112
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:35,913
A sage.

113
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,957
You're exaggerating.

114
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,959
No, more like a god!

115
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,960
Uh-oh.

116
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,424
God?

117
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,342
What are you saying?

118
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,803
Humans cannot be gods.

119
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,598
Please retract that comment.

120
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,270
I take it back.

121
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,272
Forgive me.

122
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,108
Be careful from now on.

123
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,277
<i>You idiot.</i>

124
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,446
<i>Some things can't be said aloud.</i>

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,409
That concludes today's lesson.

126
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,869
May God bless you.

127
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,499
Oh, Rafal.

128
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,459
- I have a favor to ask.
- Oh?

129
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,252
What is it?

130
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,338
I need you to-- Huh?

131
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,340
Is that a catalog of stars?

132
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,799
Uh, yes!

133
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,594
Yesterday, I saw my first
sixth-magnitude star.

134
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,137
It was so exciting!

135
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,389
I see.

136
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,099
Then you must stop.

137
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,017
What?

138
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,313
You must devote all your time
to theology from now on.

139
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,357
No more astronomy.

140
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,859
Understood?

141
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,822
Y-Yes sir.

142
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,574
Good.

143
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,451
As for the favor,

144
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,664
I'd like you to pick up
my acquaintance Hubert tomorrow.

145
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,542
Hubert?

146
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,044
Wasn't he arrested as a heretic?

147
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,630
Something about forbidden research.

148
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,508
Is it okay to take him in?

149
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,468
Yes. It's fine.

150
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,804
He recanted, so they're releasing him.

151
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,975
Willingness to forgive sins
is a sign of devout faith.

152
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,103
I'll be loaning him
a place to live as well.

153
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,397
Now then. I'm counting on you.

154
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,542
You must devote all your time
to theology from now on.

155
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,335
No more astronomy.

156
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,380
<i>It's only natural.</i>

157
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,091
<i>I've got no time for astronomy.</i>

158
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,776
<i>Stop it.
You've got to forget about the sky.</i>

159
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,153
<i>What does it matter?</i>

160
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,573
<i>There was a time
when I saw a rational beauty</i>

161
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,160
<i>in the orderly movements of stars.</i>

162
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,287
<i>But when I looked deeper,</i>

163
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,624
<i>every star's movement
has its own complex calculations.</i>

164
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,128
<i>Continuing with astronomy isn't rational.</i>

165
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,963
<i>Plus,</i>

166
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,132
<i>the world of stars is so far away.</i>

167
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,469
<i>No matter how we stretch,</i>

168
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,721
<i>no human can ever reach them.</i>

169
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,526
<i>Hubert...</i>

170
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>A former scholar and heretic.</i>

171
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,657
<i>What kind of person could he be?</i>

172
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,533
<i>No matter how you look at it,</i>

173
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,243
<i>it's not a smart way to live.</i>

174
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>Speak of the devil.</i>

175
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,711
<i>A heretic was scheduled
for execution today.</i>

176
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,850
<i>Come on, they defied God!</i>

177
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,353
<i>Surely there were chances to recant.</i>

178
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,605
<i>They brought it on themselves.</i>

179
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,359
Hurry up and burn already.

180
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,030
What's taking so long?

181
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,866
<i>What's with that guy?</i>

182
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,869
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

183
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,250
Excuse me!

184
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,545
I'm Rafal, ward of Potocki.

185
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,672
I'm here for Hubert.

186
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,090
Oh, uh...

187
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,676
Right.

188
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,906
<i>Whoa! He's huge!</i>

189
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,076
<i>This guy is suspicious to the core!</i>

190
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,079
Pleasure to meet you.

191
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,206
I'm Potocki's ward, Rafal.

192
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,709
I look forward to knowing you.

193
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,464
Huh?

194
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,799
Uh, um...

195
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,303
I offer no benefit to you.

196
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,432
You don't have to win
my favor with a false smile.

197
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,808
What?

198
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,560
But...

199
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,687
Now then. Please guide me.

200
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,005
I've heard about you.

201
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,091
You're going to university?

202
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,094
Uh, yes! It's an honor.

203
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,847
I owe it to God
and everyone who has supported--

204
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,599
Will you study astronomy?

205
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,517
What?

206
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,893
You must look at stars

207
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,479
if you carry an astrolabe.

208
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,649
Oh, uh... This is...

209
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,653
How do I put it? It's just a hobby.

210
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,613
I've been thinking of quitting.

211
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,782
I'm going to study theology--

212
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,909
You're rather insincere.

213
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,827
Huh?

214
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,139
So, Hubert, what were you
researching before?

215
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,314
Is that wax tablet
a record of your observations?

216
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,359
Yes.

217
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,945
To the best of my ability, I--

218
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,781
- Show me.
- Whoa! Hey...

219
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,877
Excellent.

220
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,211
What?

221
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,381
You've seen all the way
to the sixth magnitude.

222
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,341
You have good eyes.

223
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,301
What?

224
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,220
Oh, but those are just jottings.

225
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,266
I have more precise notes at home.

226
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,560
You do? I'd like to see them.

227
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,396
I can continue my research with these.

228
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,314
Right!

229
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,815
Of course, I--

230
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,151
Huh?

231
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,528
Did you say... research?

232
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,656
You abandoned your research, didn't you?

233
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,992
I'm a scholar.

234
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,413
No matter what anyone says,
I will never abandon my research.

235
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,792
Huh? Does that mean you haven't recanted?

236
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,463
Of course not.
I lied to obtain my release.

237
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:27,134
Although, I will keep up the act
to avoid being caught.

238
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,469
{\an8}Wha--

239
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,391
{\an8}Why did you reveal that so bluntly?

240
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,812
Because I'm about to blackmail you.

241
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,193
What?!

242
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,737
{\an8}Listen to me.

243
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,864
{\an8}Research requires observation.

244
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,992
{\an8}However, my eyes have weakened.

245
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,453
{\an8}That's why I'll use yours.

246
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,748
A heretic caught twice
is immediately executed.

247
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,875
I'm out of chances.

248
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,879
{\an8}I came back to finish what I started.

249
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,924
{\an8}And I'll jump through fire to do it.

250
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,927
My apologies,
but if you refuse, I'll kill you.

251
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,679
If you interfere, I'll kill you.

252
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,432
If you don't do what I say
at all times, I'll kill you.

253
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,143
So continue astronomy!

254
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,895
For my sake.

255
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,689
That's an order.

256
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,315
Understood?

257
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,818
Y-Yes! I'll do it!

258
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,444
I'll do anything you say!

259
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,117
Don't worry.

260
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,077
I'm not an unreasonable man.

261
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,831
I-I'm glad to hear you say that.

262
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,166
Where do you usually observe?

263
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,129
A hill to the southeast.

264
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,923
I know a better spot.

265
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,385
You're in for a surprise.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

266
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,637
R-Right.

267
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,432
Well, I'll be going.

268
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,816
What the heck?!

269
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,321
<i>Why the heck did they let that creep out?</i>

270
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,823
<i>He should be burned alive!</i>

271
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,366
<i>I'll turn him in right away.</i>

272
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>Does he really think I'll go tomorrow?!</i>

273
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>I know a better spot.</i>

274
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,749
<i>You're in for a surprise.</i>

275
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,051
<i>Come on. This is way too dangerous.</i>

276
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,511
<i>There's no way I'll go.</i>

277
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,346
<i>Nothing good will come of it!</i>

278
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,104
Wow... Amazing!

279
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,481
I'm so glad I came!

280
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,691
I never knew they could be so clear!

281
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,111
Indeed.

282
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,073
The altitude is high,
the field of view is broad,

283
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,533
and the air is clear.

284
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,203
It's perfect for observation.

285
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,747
Not only that...

286
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:08,128
I'm fond of the way those mountains
and rocks resemble Orion's Belt.

287
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,547
Oh... right.

288
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,426
Observation is difficult
once the moon is out.

289
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,596
I'll calculate the time retroactively,

290
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,389
so make your record now.

291
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,307
Right.

292
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,491
Is this good enough?

293
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,715
Incredible.
This many in such a short time.

294
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,927
Oh, uh... thanks.

295
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,308
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

296
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,188
What exactly will you
use these records for?

297
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,568
This forbidden research of yours...

298
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,196
What is it?

299
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,079
Have you heard of Aristarchus?

300
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,165
Huh? What is that?

301
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,086
In that case, do you know the shape

302
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,921
of the cosmos?

303
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,423
Huh?

304
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,549
Yes.

305
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,426
Earth is at the center,

306
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,346
and all the heavenly bodies
perform complex revolutions around it.

307
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,516
- Draw it for me then.
- What?

308
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,861
Something like this, I think.

309
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,238
It's hard to understand,

310
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,367
but Ptolemy discovered the truth
over 1,000 years ago.

311
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,831
Plus, common sense
tells us that the Earth is special.

312
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,210
I believe God
would place it at the center.

313
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,879
Indeed.

314
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,217
In that case,
is there beauty in such truth?

315
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,219
What?

316
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,722
Is the universe you described beautiful?

317
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:33,649
Whether it's beautiful or not
depends on the sense of the individual.

318
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,318
It has nothing to do with scholarly truth.

319
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,487
You didn't answer the question.

320
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,783
Do you find it to be beautiful?

321
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:57,256
Well, it does seem
a little too complicated.

322
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:02,344
With this model, every planet
has to be calculated separately.

323
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,514
The way the movements fail to form

324
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,391
a single orderly system...

325
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,978
doesn't seem rational.

326
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,814
In that sense,

327
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,984
{\an8}it's not very beautiful.

328
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,906
But while the lack
of beauty is unfortunate,

329
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:28,120
there could never be one system
that accounted for the entire universe.

330
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,456
It makes no sense
to fault the universe for that.

331
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,458
No, it's a major fault.

332
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,418
What?

333
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,672
I don't want to live
in a universe that isn't beautiful.

334
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,967
Even if that's the case,

335
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,929
to place beauty before logic
is just plain backwards.

336
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,599
It may be complicated,
but the theory is highly accurate.

337
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,520
As long as the stars move
and the sun rises, that is.

338
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,442
And what if neither the sun
nor the stars actually move?

339
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,447
Come on, a theory like that
would never hold up.

340
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,157
But it does.

341
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:10,579
If that's true, then what's moving
in the universe as we speak?

342
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,039
The Earth.

343
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,792
{\an8}The Earth? But that's--

344
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,756
Wait... The Earth?

345
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,427
That's right.

346
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,556
The sun does not rise. We descend.

347
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,310
Morning comes every day

348
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,812
because the Earth rotates

349
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,731
on its own axis.

350
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,193
In addition, the seasons change

351
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,739
because the Earth moves
in an orbital revolution around the sun.

352
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:51,119
In my universe,
the Earth moves in two ways.

353
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,875
Meanwhile, the sun remains still,

354
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,295
and the individual planets
move in sequence.

355
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,840
The cosmos is unified
under a single order.

356
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,967
{\an8}Common sense is overturned.

357
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,261
{\an8}The Church is enraged.

358
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,473
Reason and beauty become one.

359
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,602
That is my research.

360
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,064
I suppose

361
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,607
we could call it...

362
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,613
heliocentrism.

363
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,323
How about that?

364
