00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,211
{\an8}EPISODE TWO
AND NOW... I'M GOING TO MOVE THE EARTH

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,296
{\an8}If it's the Earth that moves,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,133
{\an8}reason and beauty become one.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,431
The cosmos is unified
under a single order.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,644
If the theory accepted
by the Church is the geocentric model,

6
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,898
mine is heliocentrism. How about that?

7
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,195
Helio... centrism?

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,365
S-Such an idea...

9
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,577
could...

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,495
No.

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,958
That's just plain wrong.

12
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,712
I'll give you three reasons.

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,134
First, there are too many contradictions.

14
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,137
If the Earth is moving...

15
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,769
why do I land in the same spot
when I jump?

16
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,396
Second.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,899
If we accept that the Earth is moving,

18
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,609
who would support that theory?

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,695
The Earth is at the center of the universe

20
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,449
because God wanted
humankind's home to be special.

21
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,577
To deny that would be disastrous.

22
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,872
And third.

23
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,750
Risking your life for intuition

24
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,627
is foolish.

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,630
A sound argument.

26
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,549
However, I disagree with your third point.

27
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,805
It's because my life is on the line

28
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,348
that I believe my intuition.

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,394
And what if you're wrong?

30
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,939
It doesn't matter.

31
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,983
A wrong answer is not a meaningless one.

32
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,821
"A wrong answer is not a meaningless one"?

33
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,156
Are you insane?

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,660
I don't find
your heliocentric theory beautiful,

35
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,663
nor will I jump through fire to prove it.

36
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,458
I don't want to come here tomorrow.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,793
Is that so?

38
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,420
Huh?

39
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,173
I'll see you tomorrow then.

40
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,019
<i>The heavens are still,
and the Earth moves?</i>

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,774
<i>Not only that,
but it rotates and revolves too?</i>

42
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,154
<i>How could something
that ridiculous be true?</i>

43
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,323
<i>Just look.</i>

44
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,660
<i>Even now, the stars are moving
in small increments.</i>

45
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,122
<i>Watch for an hour, and it's clear.</i>

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>Even the idea of rotation is impossible.</i>

47
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,095
Man, that hurt!

48
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,889
How clumsy of me.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,101
I thought the mountains
flipped over for a second.

50
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,774
{\an8}The mountains flipped over?

51
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,945
<i>B-But that's only because</i>

52
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,739
<i>I was moving.</i>

53
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,200
<i>It's not the mountains that moved.</i>

54
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,995
<i>That much is obvious.</i>

55
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,832
<i>But if I extend that obvious logic...</i>

56
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,256
<i>If I'm the Earth,
and the mountains are the Sun...</i>

57
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,343
<i>If the observer moves...</i>

58
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,180
<i>the still object in the distance</i>

59
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,724
<i>will also appear to move.</i>

60
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,691
{\an8}It may... be rotating.

61
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,777
<i>No, wait!</i>

62
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,197
Even if I accepted the rotation...

63
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,534
there's no way it's revolving.

64
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,205
<i>Let's say Earth moves
for the sake of argument.</i>

65
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,292
<i>I'll apply Ptolemy's model
to the heliocentric theory.</i>

66
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,963
<i>I just need to expand
or shrink the epicyclical radius</i>

67
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,466
<i>of the planets thought to be
beyond the Sun to equal the radius</i>

68
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,718
<i>of the current Sun's revolution.</i>

69
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,012
<i>For planets closer than the Sun,</i>

70
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,723
<i>I'll expand the center
of their epicycles to equal the Sun.</i>

71
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,143
<i>If their induction path
is the same as the current Sun's orbit,</i>

72
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,648
<i>and the Earth followed the same path
as it revolved around the Sun...</i>

73
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,654
<i>This is ridiculous blasphemy.</i>

74
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,364
<i>It's nonsense and plain wrong.</i>

75
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,534
<i>Not only that, I could be arrested.</i>

76
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,327
<i>I have no reason to pursue it.</i>

77
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,581
<i>The individual planets move in sequence,</i>

78
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,085
<i>and the cosmos is unified
under a single order.</i>

79
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>Everything moves in a harmonious sequence?</i>

80
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,301
<i>The entire universe moves
under a single order?</i>

81
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,555
<i>It's all lies!</i>

82
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,099
<i>The planets move independently.</i>

83
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,144
<i>That has to be it.</i>

84
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,145
<i>Because if not...</i>

85
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,607
<i>If the vastness of heaven</i>

86
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,276
<i>moved with one mind</i>

87
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,321
<i>in such a rational way...</i>

88
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,991
<i>I can't help but see...</i>

89
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,662
<i>this theory as beautiful!</i>

90
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,165
EARTH

91
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,168
SUN, EARTH

92
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,422
It may... be true.

93
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,740
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

94
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,563
Your observations have grown
even more precise lately.

95
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,773
Did something change?

96
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,530
If I may.

97
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,076
Hubert,

98
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,744
why put yourself in danger

99
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,540
and give up your place in heaven
just for this?

100
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,085
{\an8}Do you want to deny the existence of God?

101
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,670
It's the opposite.

102
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,756
I do it because I believe in God.

103
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,428
Most people believe

104
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,265
this world is an ugly place
filled with greed and corruption,

105
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,893
while the afterlife is pure and beautiful.

106
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,394
But

107
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,272
I can't accept that.

108
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,609
This world created by God

109
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,528
is surely the most beautiful of all.

110
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:15,244
A person doesn't need
faith, money, or status to know that.

111
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,456
I will show

112
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,083
that even trapped in this tiny skull,

113
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,170
my intellect is all I need
to understand God's works.

114
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,466
That's why I don't read
the holy scripture.

115
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,884
I read nature.

116
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,972
But doesn't a life like that...

117
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,434
frighten you?

118
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,186
It does.

119
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,606
Even so,

120
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,610
a life that isn't frightening
is missing its essence.

121
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,492
Oh, and one more thing.

122
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,786
This is your last day of observation.

123
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,496
What?

124
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,000
I've discovered a way to continue alone.

125
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,547
Then what do I do from tomorrow?

126
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,842
Good question. You're free to choose.

127
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,136
However,

128
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,972
continue astronomy.

129
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,807
For your own sake.

130
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,646
Though that's just a suggestion.

131
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,650
Well, thank you for everything.

132
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,410
<i>It's over.</i>

133
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,911
<i>Just like that.</i>

134
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,330
<i>What was this all about?</i>

135
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,499
<i>"Continue astronomy," he says?</i>

136
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,293
<i>I can't do that.</i>

137
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,466
Potocki? Why is he in front of the house?

138
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,094
Hi!

139
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,680
Huh?

140
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,349
Hello there.

141
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,023
Are you Rafal?

142
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,942
I'm the Inquisitor, Nowak.

143
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,363
I'm here to inquire about Hubert's actions
since his recantation.

144
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,824
I-Is that so?

145
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:21,162
Hubert has fully reformed,
and he's been living modestly.

146
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,664
Oh? I'm glad to hear that.

147
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:29,128
After all, a man charged
as a heretic twice will be put to death.

148
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,340
His collaborators
would face serious charges too.

149
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,426
All that extra work
is no fun for me either.

150
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,845
Th-That sounds rough.

151
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,264
I can't tolerate those foolish heretics.

152
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,224
Glad to have your support.

153
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,353
So tell me then...

154
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,315
What's this?

155
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,861
I found it in your bookcase.

156
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,822
I haven't told Potocki yet,

157
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:01,744
but it sure seems to contain
detailed notes about blasphemous research.

158
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,829
What is this?

159
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,915
It's... uh...

160
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,085
What could it be?

161
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,089
That belongs to me.

162
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,592
H-Hubert?!

163
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,097
I thought it would be harder to find
if I hid it in that child's room,

164
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,266
but it seems I've been caught.

165
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,020
Oh? So that's the case, is it?

166
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,274
But you'd better think carefully, Hubert.

167
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,567
Do you realize

168
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,113
where such a statement will lead you?

169
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,369
{\an8}I came back to finish what I started.

170
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,415
Be honest, please.

171
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,751
Does this really belong to you?

172
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,046
Of course it does.

173
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,717
In fact, you're the one
who should think carefully.

174
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,263
Do you really think a child
could assist with my research?

175
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,809
Well, I suppose that's true.

176
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,894
Sorry about that, Rafal.

177
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,066
- In that case, put Hubert under arrest.
- Huh?

178
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,069
Wait!

179
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,696
So suddenly?!

180
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,990
Oh, that's right.

181
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,119
{\an8}I came to give you this.

182
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,667
- Farewell.
- Huh?

183
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,003
Hubert!

184
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,715
Will you really just go?

185
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,134
Weren't you going to finish something?

186
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,389
I just did.

187
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,732
<i>And so, Hubert</i>

188
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,525
<i>was burned to death.</i>

189
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,072
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

190
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:02,990
<i>- Orb.
- Orb.</i>

191
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,833
<i>He died.</i>

192
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,752
<i>To save me.</i>

193
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,963
<i>I know he was a heretic,</i>

194
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,133
<i>but what was the right thing for me to do?</i>

195
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,136
<i>His unfinished work...</i>

196
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,056
{\an8}Three stars.

197
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,226
{\an8}Orion's Belt?

198
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,021
Why is only Alnilam
in the center painted black?

199
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,233
I'm fond of the way

200
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:42,988
those mountains
and rocks resemble Orion's Belt.

201
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,782
{\an8}Wait!

202
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,139
I've come to the mountain
that represents Alnilam,

203
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,641
but I don't see--

204
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,910
This is

205
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,745
a letter?

206
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,417
"To the person who finds this letter."

207
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,879
<i>Please forgive the curt opening,</i>

208
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,756
<i>but I have no idea who you are.</i>

209
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,927
<i>However, I have decided
to entrust my necklace</i>

210
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,263
<i>to the one I deem most trustworthy.</i>

211
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,683
<i>Now to the main order of business.</i>

212
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,520
<i>The documents you see here
comprise my lifetime of research</i>

213
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,272
<i>into heliocentrism.</i>

214
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,443
<i>I now place all my trust in you</i>

215
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,696
<i>and beg you to finish what I started.</i>

216
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,948
<i>Please,</i>

217
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,159
<i>burn everything.</i>

218
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:16,040
<i>I am confident that I have spent more time
with heliocentrism than anyone else.</i>

219
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,791
<i>Because of that,</i>

220
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,336
<i>there is something I alone know.</i>

221
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,004
SUN, EARTH

222
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,381
<i>Heliocentrism can likely never be proven.</i>

223
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,135
<i>There are too many uncertain factors.</i>

224
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>It surely must be</i>

225
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,723
<i>the realm of God himself.</i>

226
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,892
<i>If that is the case,</i>

227
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,561
<i>such an imperfect theory should disappear.</i>

228
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,649
<i>Despite that, I don't have the will</i>

229
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,484
<i>or the courage to burn it myself.</i>

230
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,653
<i>Instead, it is my selfish hope</i>

231
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,531
<i>that someone superior to me
will dispose of it forever.</i>

232
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,910
<i>That is you.</i>

233
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,163
<i>You are capable of burning it.</i>

234
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:01,001
<i>Your powers of reason
are far stronger than my intuition.</i>

235
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,128
<i>You can do it.</i>

236
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,507
<i>A reward for the task
can be found in the box.</i>

237
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,717
<i>The amount should be sufficient.</i>

238
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,013
<i>And so, I leave it to you.</i>

239
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,019
<i>Well, it is what it is.</i>

240
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,023
<i>I understand why he chose
to leave this letter too.</i>

241
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,735
<i>Heliocentrism is indeed an amazing idea.</i>

242
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,614
<i>But it's too dangerous,
too out of step with the times,</i>

243
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,951
<i>and more than anything else,
too uncertain.</i>

244
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,371
<i>This is the most reasonable outcome.</i>

245
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,957
<i>The materials must be burned.</i>

246
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,210
<i>It's just as Hubert said.</i>

247
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,630
<i>My powers of reason</i>

248
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,257
<i>set the documents aflame.</i>

249
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,684
<i>But...</i>

250
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,774
Ow!

251
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,361
More than that reasoning,

252
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,115
my intuition wants to believe
in heliocentrism!

253
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,038
Everyone, listen up!

254
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,876
While we're sorry to see him go,
today is the day Rafal leaves our school!

255
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,793
However,

256
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,671
he'll be attending university.

257
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,465
And everyone,

258
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,134
what is the most appropriate field
for him to study?

259
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,094
Do you remember?

260
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,513
- Theology!
- Theology!

261
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,681
That's right.

262
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,393
Rafal, do you have any parting words?

263
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,311
Yes.

264
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,108
Thank you for all you've done for me.

265
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,486
We won't see each other anymore,

266
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,739
but I pray that you receive
God's blessings.

267
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,283
Oh, and one more thing.

268
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,246
I'm going to study astronomy.

269
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,712
<i>Though it pains me to say it,
the world is full of fools.</i>

270
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,550
<i>And before I knew it,
I was at the head of the line.</i>

271
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,222
<i>The real me</i>

272
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:22,476
<i>is neither dignified,
nor wise, humble, or capable.</i>

273
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,104
<i>What I am is arrogant, brazen,</i>

274
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,980
<i>rash, and helpless.</i>

275
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,943
<i>And now... I'm going to move the Earth.</i>

276
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,620
If you need help, just ask an adult.

277
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,499
See? Just like that.

278
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,379
Here you go.

279
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,880
Thank you very much!

280
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,175
I can't just ignore a crying child.

281
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,386
Be good to your family, okay?

282
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,388
Yes, sir!

283
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,307
Nowak, we'd better get moving.

284
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,018
Huh? Oh, right.

285
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,151
I hope you'll forgive the sudden visit.

286
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,030
What do you intend to do?

287
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,199
I have a child!

288
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,037
Oh, is that so? I have a daughter myself.

289
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,292
She just turned four,
and she's quite cute.

290
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,130
Look, this is a letter from my daughter.

291
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,674
I always carry it with me.

292
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,554
Whenever I think of her,
I get the same feelings.

293
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,141
Comfort, strength, and...

294
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,019
worry.

295
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,481
Love for my child
has become my reason to live.

296
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,943
I don't ever want her to suffer.

297
00:19:55,986 --> 00:20:00,574
So any research that will disrupt
the peace can't be overlooked.

298
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:07,206
To tell the truth, I don't have
any lofty ideals like protecting humanity.

299
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,500
But when it comes to protecting
the lives and faith

300
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,837
of my family and friends,

301
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,423
there's nothing I won't do.

302
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,220
I'm home!

303
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,265
Oh, my.

304
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,809
So this was your family.

305
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,571
Okay, this is where the wicked gather.

306
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,156
I'll leave the rest to you.

307
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,825
I have dinner with my family to get to.

308
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,910
Huh?

309
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,371
Aren't inquisitors celibate too?

310
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,122
You didn't know?

311
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,959
Nowak never joined the clergy.
He's a layperson.

312
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,669
I don't know the details,

313
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,631
but the Bishop thinks highly of him
and made an exception.

314
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,383
He was once a mercenary.

315
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,093
A mercenary?

316
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,845
How could such bloody hands
do the Lord's work?

317
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,597
It's unthinkable.

318
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,433
How could this be?

319
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,270
Don't get so disheartened.

320
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,064
I'm sure the Bishop has his reasons.

321
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,359
You must

322
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,278
be joking.

323
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,614
You're joking, right?

324
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,076
Huh?

325
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:32,749
Not only are you abandoning theology,
but it's to study astronomy?

326
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,546
Has Hubert being arrested as a heretic

327
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,756
momentarily robbed you of your senses?

328
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,636
If you don't retract that statement,

329
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,015
I won't sign
this university admission form!

330
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,687
<i>Recently,</i>

331
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,774
<i>after my sudden change in direction,</i>

332
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,069
<i>my future has grown quite precarious.</i>

333
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,656
<i>Being honest,</i>

334
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,366
<i>skillfully explaining myself,</i>

335
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,202
<i>and settling all concerns
would be a Herculean task.</i>

336
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,249
{\an8}Now, declare it!

337
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,918
{\an8}You won't study astronomy!

338
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,296
<i>And so...</i>

339
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,799
Understood. I declare it.

340
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,552
I'll never study astronomy again.

341
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,138
<i>...I simply lied.</i>

342
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,226
Oh, my son!
You've returned to your normal self?

343
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,520
Yes! I was being a fool!

344
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,689
I'm so happy!

345
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,484
<i>One can express anything in words.</i>

346
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,778
<i>That's why lying is so convenient.</i>

347
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,074
<i>The rational judgment I've developed</i>

348
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,576
<i>can help me avoid trouble.</i>

349
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,707
<i>Right. That's the way.</i>

350
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,543
<i>Even if I enroll in theology,</i>

351
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,629
<i>I can transfer to astronomy later.</i>

352
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,841
<i>Not going to university
would defeat the purpose.</i>

353
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,428
<i>Proving heliocentrism</i>

354
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,056
<i>could take 30 or 40 years.</i>

355
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,267
<i>But even then, it's no pipe dream.</i>

356
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,729
<i>I just need to proceed little by little.</i>

357
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,774
<i>Still,</i>

358
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,985
<i>if my father hates astronomy so much,</i>

359
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,199
<i>why are there so many
