1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,800
Now then. I'll get straight to the point.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,428
Why did you let her go?

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,729
{\an8}No matter... what the truth is,

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,815
{\an8}you intended to kill her.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,861
A most unthoughtful reply.

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,947
I can't stand unthoughtful people,

7
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,325
so I'll let you do some thinking.

8
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,707
When you make a decision
under uncertain circumstances,

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,209
you should first imagine
the worst-case scenario.

10
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,046
False accusations are deplorable.

11
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,133
But releasing heretics
out of fear of false accusations

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,968
is even more so.

13
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,386
A false accusation

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,305
will lead to one innocent death.

15
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,099
But if a heretic gets away, at worst,

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,186
it could lead to the death
of all humankind.

17
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,815
{\an8}Do you understand the situation now?

18
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,778
Our enemies are not
mere lowlife criminals.

19
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,905
The heretic you let go

20
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,741
may be the enemy of humans everywhere.

21
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,496
"Love thy enemy."

22
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,710
{\an8}I devote myself to those words.

23
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,213
{\an8}I see.

24
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,508
{\an8}Idiots like you
often misinterpret that verse.

25
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,635
{\an8}Brush up on your theology.

26
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,765
Does Nowak know about this?

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,851
We haven't contacted him yet.

28
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,853
Then tell him this.

29
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,147
Jolenta was a heretic.

30
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,358
She attempted to escape,

31
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,528
took a hostage,
and wounded others in the process.

32
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,947
We were forced to execute her immediately.

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,368
Following that,
we carried out official procedures

34
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,744
and burned her at the stake.

35
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,331
Before spreading the ashes in the river,
show Nowak the body.

36
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,084
Tell him it's hers.

37
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,418
Huh?

38
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,797
But where will you get a body?

39
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,800
There's one right here.

40
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,140
This idiot will burn.

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,449
Okay... Go ahead and burn them.

42
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,375
Nowak!

43
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,793
Huh?

44
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,381
{\an8}Just now, at Gallows Number Eight...

45
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,299
What?

46
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,218
Um...

47
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,973
What is it? Spit it out.

48
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,434
I'd like to go home.

49
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,439
{\an8}Your daughter was arrested as a heretic.

50
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,566
{\an8}She tried to escape

51
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,693
{\an8}and is now being executed.

52
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,482
My condolences.

53
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,447
I've heard she was quite intelligent.

54
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,034
I tried to oppose the decision.

55
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,329
She still had a future.

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,585
That's right. I brought these for you.

57
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,842
I asked the others not to burn them.

58
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,470
So you could grieve her.

59
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,309
It's against regulations,
but this is a special case.

60
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,980
To be honest,

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,109
I've never had
a good impression of you inquisitors.

62
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,777
But now

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,072
I see how courageous you really are.

64
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,374
Please allow me

65
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,583
to pray for her too.

66
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,383

69
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,797
Father! Welcome back!

70
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,842
I'm home, Jolenta.

71
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,970
Were you studying today too?

72
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,305
Good girl.

73
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,183
Yes...

74
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,936
Hey, what's with the long face?

75
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,647
Huh?

76
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,859
Um, look at this.

77
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,695
I don't know if I did it right, but...

78
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,912
"Thank you for always working hard

79
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,498
for God and all of us."

80
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,293
You wrote this letter for me?

81
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,879
Uh, yes.

82
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,132
Is my handwriting poor?

83
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,970
What a sweet child you are.

84
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,598
I've never seen such beautiful penmanship.

85
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,851
I'd better learn from your diligence.

86
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
Huh?

87
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,039
Wow! They're great!

88
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,222
Y-You mean it?

89
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,976
Yeah. They'll arrive next week.

90
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,562
I ordered ones just your size.

91
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,689
Yay!

92
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,358
I asked a first-rate artisan too.

93
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,027
Now your hands
won't get cold when you study.

94
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,446
Thank you, Father!

95
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,616
Those words aren't for me.

96
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,534
Huh?

97
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,873
This is the fate that God has granted you.

98
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,587
So when good things happen,
you must first give thanks to God.

99
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,839
- Got it?
- Yes!

100
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,760
Thank you, Lord, for this blessing.

101
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,266
I'm sorry, Jolenta.

102
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,643
Can't you cheer up?

103
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,522
But... you lied to me.

104
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,359
You said the gloves would be just my size!

105
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,029
These are way too big!

106
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,407
It wasn't a lie or anything.

107
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,285
Something must have
gone wrong with the order.

108
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,662
I'm really sorry.

109
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,040
I'll make up for it somehow.

110
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,127
So, please... it's no one's fault.

111
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,422
I never intended to hurt you.

112
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,175
Then it's God's fault.

113
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,555
What... did you say?

114
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,766
You said so, didn't you?

115
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,353
This is the fate that God has granted me!

116
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,605
That means God is at fault!

117
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,608
Take that back! Right now!

118
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,234
Those words are unforgivable!

119
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,164
F-Forget it.

120
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,957
Go get your head straight!

121
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,799
<i>What have I done?</i>

122
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,555
{\an8}<i>I didn't need to get so angry.</i>

123
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,057
{\an8}<i>What’s wrong with me?</i>

124
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,144
{\an8}<i>Then again, faith...</i>

125
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,190
{\an8}<i>Teaching her faith is most important.</i>

126
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,734
{\an8}<i>That may be,</i>

127
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,155
{\an8}<i>but when a child is crying,</i>

128
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,951
<i>what could be more important
than comforting them?</i>

129
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,415
Uh, Jolenta?

130
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,168
I-I'm sorry!

131
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:55,715
You work hard for God's sake every day.

132
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,342
It's wrong of me to say

133
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,677
that God is at fault!

134
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,891
Look! If I wear them like this,

135
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,936
they fit fine--

136
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm really sorry.

137
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,694
Forgive me for being such a fool.

138
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,329
Well,

139
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,956
I'm off!

{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

142
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,454
Who would have thought this would happen?

143
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,582
Yes, it's a first in all my years.

144
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,460
I knew I hadn't seen him lately,

145
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,631
but I would've never imagined
Badeni had been executed as a heretic.

146
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:05,636
Their battle was right nearby
while we slept, right?

147
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,472
What a frightening turn of events.

148
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:13,185
Did you ever notice him
acting suspiciously, Father Grabowski?

149
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,230
Yes, I'm curious about that too.

150
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,900
Well, how can I put it?

151
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,446
Everything he did was suspicious,
so it's hard to name an example.

152
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,157
Oh, I guess that's true.

153
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,869
Even his appearance was suspicious.

154
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,581
That eye patch he wore frightened me.

155
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:38,043
Even so, a heretic from our village?

156
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,462
Who was it that noticed?

157
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,216
I heard they received an anonymous tip.

158
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,677
I see.

159
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,722
Whoever it was, we owe them one.

160
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,600
Now we can sleep soundly at night.

161
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,020
Huh? That reminds me.

162
00:14:56,103 --> 00:15:00,065
Didn't you send in a tip recently,
Father Grabowski?

163
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,693
Oh, uh... yes.

164
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,697
Six months ago, I was heading
to the library in the next town,

165
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,574
and I found a book.

166
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,663
<i>I opened it out of curiosity,</i>

167
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,081
<i>and it was full of codes.</i>

168
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,751
I was suspicious,

169
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,378
so I spent a few months decoding it.

170
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,299
The second half seemed to contain
blasphemous ideas.

171
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,388
Oh, but that was the next town over.

172
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,682
It has nothing to do with Badeni.

173
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,644
I see. So that's all it was?

174
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,857
<i>The reason cited</i>

175
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,736
<i>for Badeni's execution
was simply "blasphemy."</i>

176
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,196
<i>There were no details.</i>

177
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,114
<i>It's an inexplicably simple charge,</i>

178
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,368
<i>but was it related to his research?</i>

179
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,120
<i>And if so, what was he researching?</i>

180
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,664
<i>Furthermore,</i>

181
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,751
<i>if he didn't leave notes
about his research behind,</i>

182
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:05,673
<i>then both the research
and his personal history would be lost.</i>

183
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,011
<i>If my tip was responsible for that...</i>

184
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,055
<i>What have I...</i>

185
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,896
<i>No, it's not possible.</i>

186
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,023
<i>Even if it was his book,</i>

187
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,652
<i>they surely wouldn't
execute him just for that.</i>

188
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,030
What is this?

189
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,033
A letter?

190
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,786
The sender didn't write their name.

191
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,999
It's a poem by Lucretius!

192
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,253
In that case, have you read
Lucretius's work too?

193
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,422
The poet who praised Epicurus.

194
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,132
Well, yes.

195
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,801
If you've read his works,

196
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,554
I'd be grateful
if you could share even a portion--

197
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,180
I'm afraid I refuse.

198
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,226
<i>D-Don't tell me this is from...</i>

199
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,438
"The poem written here

200
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,858
is what I can remember
of Lucretius's work."

201
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,862
"It's only shorthand fragments,
so it's not precise."

202
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,572
"I apologize."

203
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:17,077
{\an8}"In return for the poem,
I have a favor to ask."

204
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:22,875
{\an8}<i>If you happen to be visited
by a certain beggar, please receive them.</i>

205
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,251
{\an8}Huh?

206
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,088
{\an8}<i>I realize that you're unlikely
to fulfill this request.</i>

207
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,967
{\an8}<i>There's no benefit for you,
and I'm not held in high esteem.</i>

208
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,345
{\an8}<i>I have no way to convince you.</i>

209
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,638
<i>And that's why,</i>

210
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,350
<i>despite knowing that
these words hold little sway,</i>

211
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,229
<i>I beg you from the bottom of my heart.</i>

212
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,192
<i>P.S.</i>

213
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,652
<i>This is unrelated to the main request,</i>

214
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,406
<i>and a petty nuisance on top of that,</i>

215
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:59,578
<i>but if you don't mind,
please educate the beggars somehow.</i>

216
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,413
<i>That is all.</i>

217
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,089
<i>Right now,</i>

218
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,216
<i>I am laying eyes on</i>

219
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,594
<i>the poetry of Lucretius,
a man who lived 1,500 years ago.</i>

220
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,847
<i>I can do so because others</i>

221
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,642
<i>spread and preserved his words in writing.</i>

222
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,564
<i>In that case,
if portions of Badeni's research</i>

223
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,274
<i>survive somewhere now,</i>

224
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,613
<i>should they also be spread and preserved?</i>

225
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,532
No.

226
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,409
They're blasphemy after all.

227
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,828
They ought to disappear!

228
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,913
In fact, it's for the better!

229
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,353
Hey, that man with his hair tied
hasn't come lately.

230
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,564
That's why we can't get any bread.

231
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,317
Yes. God has finally abandoned us.

232
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,904
Actually, I made a promise before.

233
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,990
A promise?

234
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,743
To the man with the strange eye patch.

235
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,662
The blond one?

236
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,832
Yes. He told me something.

237
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:31,336
If a month goes by
with no contact and no bread,

238
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,088
there's a place I should go.

239
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,506
A place?

240
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,051
If we go there, we might receive bread.

241
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,678
Right.

242
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,680
Good idea. I need bread.

243
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,681
I say yes.

244
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,725
No, wait.

245
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,642
Huh?

246
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,395
It might be a trap.

247
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,814
He's the man who did <i>that</i> to our heads

248
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,734
in return for the bread.

249
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,698
Indeed. Who knows
what that man was thinking?

250
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,617
Yes, it's too dangerous.

251
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,410
We can't trust him. I say no.

252
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,787
But...

253
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,208
The one with his hair tied
was always kind.

254
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,258
Excuse me.

255
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,845
I heard that you came
all the way from the next town.

256
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,264
Can I help you?

257
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,896
So you're the one.

258
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,690
The man with the strange eye patch

259
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,151
said you were the man to ask.

260
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,154
<i>"The strange eye patch"?</i>

261
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,741
<i>I knew it. The letter was from Badeni.</i>

262
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,494
{\an8}Please come with me.

263
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,956
Wait, uh, that's...

264
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,463
<i>If you happen to be visited
by a certain beggar, please receive them.</i>

265
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,054
Very well. Please lead the way.

266
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,576
A-Aren't we there yet?

267
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,870
It's down these stairs.

268
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,178
Where are we?

269
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,639
The man with the strange eye patch

270
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,600
called us all "books."

271
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,769
What? Books?

272
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,607
{\an8}Whoa! Hey!

273
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,956
He told me I was page one.

274
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,375
What do you mean?

275
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,258
Tattooed writing...

276
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,275
There are 60 pages in all.

277
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,115
What did he mean by "books"?

278
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,037
When he cut our hair, he also told us

279
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,414
to wear hats until it grew back.

280
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,374
Why?

281
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,710
Is it...

282
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,505
Grabowski,

283
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,341
what do you think is necessary

284
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,343
to change such a world?

285
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,178
Huh?

286
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,473
Truth.

287
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,269
Is it... my turn?

288
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,957
