1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
Father will be home soon.

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>Okay, my rough notes have been burned.</i>

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>The revised documents are in here.</i>

4
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>Good. It's almost full.</i>

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,287
I'm home, Rafal!

6
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,584
He's not here?

7
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,216
Huh? What could he have burned?

8
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,852
Th-This is...

9
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,104
It can't be.

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,737
<i>As expected,</i>

11
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,157
<i>proving heliocentrism won't be easy.</i>

12
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,328
<i>The orbits I've calculated
are still far from perfect circles.</i>

13
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,666
<i>At this rate, the geocentric model
is still more accurate.</i>

14
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,627
- Hello there.
- Huh?

15
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,547
- We met the other day.
- Oh!

16
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,466
G-Good afternoon.

17
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,802
I'm sorry about all that.

18
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,137
I've heard you're pretty smart.

19
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,848
You're entering university already?

20
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,850
Oh, uh, yes!

21
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,478
I'll begin studying theology
in the next term.

22
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,939
Oh? How impressive.

23
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,984
I'll do my best to contribute to society.

24
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,820
Well then. Farewell.

25
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,154
- Just a second.
- Huh?

26
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,280
That...

27
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,950
Didn't that necklace

28
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,035
belong to Hubert?

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,578
Why are you wearing it?

30
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,416
It's a reminder.

31
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,796
A reminder of my anger at his heresy
and the need to remain vigilant.

32
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,132
Is that so?

33
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,886
Do you know what he was researching?

34
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,055
No, not a thing.

35
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,682
I see.

36
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,936
He contradicted geocentrism,

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,772
the proper model of the universe.

38
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,401
I'd just like to confirm.

39
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,571
Will you swear to God
that you weren't involved?

40
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,364
Of course. I swear it.

41
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,659
I believe in the universe
that we are taught.

42
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,082
Thanks for your cooperation.

43
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,167
If you'll excuse me.

44
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,674
<i>That freaked me out!
He can't just appear suddenly like that!</i>

45
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,302
<i>Still,</i>

46
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,346
<i>why do they put so much emphasis on words?</i>

47
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,269
<i>Huh?</i>

48
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>It didn't burn?</i>

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,026
<i>But why is it on my desk?</i>

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,528
<i>Don't tell me Father--</i>

51
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,451
My calculations have been revised.

52
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,163
That paper can have trouble burning.

53
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,125
You should watch
until it's completely burnt.

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,129
These revisions...
Did you do them, Father?

55
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,341
I know nothing about any of this.

56
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,057
<i>I've been acting too much
in the open lately.</i>

57
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,478
<i>The lack of materials
had stalled my research.</i>

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,397
<i>Maybe I should rest awhile</i>

59
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,943
<i>and resume my research
when I've settled at university.</i>

60
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,738
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

61
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,432
{\an8}Rafal!

62
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,726
{\an8}EPISODE THREE
I... BELIEVE IN HELIOCENTRISM

63
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,519
{\an8}Is he out?

64
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,448
What have I done?

65
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,534
Why did I revise those calculations?

66
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,828
<i>If...</i>

67
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,955
<i>I were to be caught...</i>

68
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,421
Hi there.

69
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,465
G-Good afternoon.

70
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,803
Sorry for the sudden intrusion.

71
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,808
I'd like to follow up
on a few matters concerning Hubert.

72
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,103
Oh, and could I have some water too?

73
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,313
Huh? Uh, yes.

74
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,901
My, my! That was some commotion.

75
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,904
Hubert was a student of yours, wasn't he?

76
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,866
Even if he was a heretic,
it must be hard on you.

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,451
N-No.

78
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,495
I recognize his heresy.

79
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,538
Furthermore,

80
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,916
he was just one of many students
I've had over the years.

81
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,502
I have no special feelings for him.

82
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,380
You have a previous charge
of heresy yourself.

83
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,176
Weren't you also researching
the heliocentric theory?

84
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,304
Th-That was a long time ago.

85
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,598
I've fully recanted.

86
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,854
I've never spoken
with Hubert about research.

87
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,733
I imagine that's true.

88
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:27,905
It's likely that Hubert looked into
your past research on his own.

89
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,160
And since your recantation,
you've devoted yourself to theology,

90
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,789
taken in orphans, and desperately
tried to improve your reputation.

91
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,377
I'm sure you want to avoid
a second charge of heresy.

92
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:47,341
Those who betray the faith twice
have the devil in their bones.

93
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,511
For the sake of the heretic too,

94
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,432
we take the strongest measures
to exorcise the evil.

95
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,101
You know what that means, right?

96
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,065
You burn them... alive.

97
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,943
Exactly.

98
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,989
I haven't directly experienced
the suffering they go through,

99
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,912
but there are some who break
their jaws clenching to resist the pain.

100
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,039
How terrifying.

101
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:25,421
However, the physical pain of the flames
is the least of their worries.

102
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,050
Someone like you will know what I mean.

103
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,638
Their bodies turn to ash.

104
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,183
There is nothing left
to be restored on Judgment Day.

105
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,773
Academics are divided
about what happens next,

106
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,275
but here's what I think.

107
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,446
I think they experience nothingness.

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,243
Memories, experiences, consciousness,
the soul, and the afterlife

109
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,286
all turn to nothing.

110
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,290
I sure wouldn't want that fate.

111
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,961
Now then...

112
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,590
Your child is conducting
blasphemous research, isn't he?

113
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,175
What?

114
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,719
{\an8}I hit the mark, huh?

115
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,558
{\an8}A heretic that young...
What is the world coming to?

116
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,102
How can you just accuse him?!

117
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,812
Do you have proof?

118
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,439
No.

119
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,108
Not yet anyway.

120
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,194
{\an8}But you know, Potocki.

121
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,240
{\an8}If you knew he was
conducting blasphemous research,

122
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,659
{\an8}and you didn't turn him in,

123
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,245
{\an8}it would be over for you.

124
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,874
If you know something,
you should tell me soon.

125
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,793
Before I gather the evidence.

126
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,213
Plus, it's only the boy's first offense.

127
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,759
If he recants,
he'll be released immediately.

128
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,430
Turning him in now
would save everyone a lot of pain.

129
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,224
Well,

130
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,352
that's all I have to say.

131
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,688
Sorry to bother you.

132
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,856
You really...

133
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,695
You really won't execute him
for a first offense?

134
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,406
No. Of course not.

135
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,622
Father.

136
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,626
Oh, Rafal.

137
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,127
So you're home.

138
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,254
Is something wrong?

139
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,548
The revisions

140
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,884
to my calculations...

141
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,843
Huh?

142
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,137
- Was it you--
- Rafal.

143
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,359
Do you think you can prove heliocentrism?

144
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,119
Yes.

145
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,375
I see.

146
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,210
Father--

147
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,296
Forgive me. Please go to bed for now.

148
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,676
We'll discuss this further tomorrow.

149
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,219
Please.

150
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,777
Good morning.

151
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,783
I'm sorry, Rafal.

152
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,245
Now then. Shall we depart?

153
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,376
That takes care of the arrangements.

154
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,671
Your torture officially begins tomorrow.

155
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,966
This here is still a prototype.

156
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,885
I call it the Pear of Anguish.

157
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,847
When you wind it,

158
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,182
it opens up like this.

159
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,978
After four turns with this in your mouth,

160
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,396
your cheeks will split,

161
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,274
and you won't speak for a year.

162
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,903
You probably don't know,
but the world is full of tools

163
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:23,701
that are designed
to inflict pain effectively.

164
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,204
Pain is something no one can escape,

165
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,459
but there are two ways to avoid it.

166
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,297
{\an8}Recant at your trial tomorrow,

167
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,967
{\an8}and proclaim you'll never
associate with astronomy again.

168
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,430
{\an8}Tell us where all your materials
are located and burn them yourself.

169
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,349
{\an8}Th-That's it?

170
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,562
Yes. Even I prefer not to torture a child.

171
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,732
Oh, and this.

172
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,317
It's yours, right?

173
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,652
Your university admission form.

174
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,946
It's still valid, you know.

175
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,033
You can recommit your life to theology.

176
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,037
The most important choice you make in life

177
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,955
is what to give up.

178
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,874
You're smart, right?

179
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,959
You'll know the right answer.

180
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,755
Until tomorrow.

181
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,299
Let's meet when you're reborn.

182
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,897
Recant and burn my materials.

183
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,484
<i>Well, I guess I can do that.</i>

184
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,278
<i>I've managed to come this far.</i>

185
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,571
<i>This too</i>

186
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,532
<i>will work out somehow.</i>

187
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,034
<i>Recanting is not the end.</i>

188
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,537
<i>Burning my materials is not the end.</i>

189
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,081
<i>Being charged is not the end.</i>

190
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,084
<i>Whether astronomy is prohibited,</i>

191
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,336
<i>or I'm all alone, it's not the end.</i>

192
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,296
<i>It's not</i>

193
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,048
<i>the end.</i>

194
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,883
<i>The end...</i>

195
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,301
<i>The end...</i>

196
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,349
<i>Why am I doing this?</i>

197
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,310
<i>How did I end up here?</i>

198
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,147
<i>If I'd never learned about heliocentrism,</i>

199
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,942
<i>I would never have found myself here.</i>

200
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,028
<i>If not for heliocentrism,</i>

201
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,781
<i>I'd still be considered intelligent.</i>

202
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,368
<i>I'd be celebrated by those around me.</i>

203
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,662
<i>My lifestyle would be comfortable,</i>

204
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,164
<i>my future would be promising,</i>

205
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,709
<i>and my path forward full of hope.</i>

206
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,921
<i>The world would still be easy.</i>

207
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,217
<i>Why did I do this?</i>

208
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,680
<i>What does heliocentrism mean to--</i>

209
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,940
Moon... light?

210
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,528
<i>Hasn't this happened before?</i>

211
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,364
<i>Just like back then,</i>

212
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,618
<i>continuing with astronomy isn't rational.</i>

213
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,037
<i>Just like back then,</i>

214
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,456
<i>the sky is far away.</i>

215
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,877
<i>Not only that,
the window I have now is even smaller.</i>

216
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,795
<i>But...</i>

217
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,380
<i>But why?</i>

218
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,884
<i>Now, more than then,</i>

219
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,677
<i>I can see the sky</i>

220
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,471
<i>clearer than ever.</i>

221
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,434
Was it always this beautiful?

222
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,696
Does the accused confess

223
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,283
to researching the heliocentric theory

224
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,995
that heavenly bodies
revolve around the Sun, rather than Earth?

225
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,498
Yes, I confess.

226
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:03,504
Were you aware that this theory
contradicts Church doctrine?

227
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes, I was.

228
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,636
{\an8}The Church seeks from the accused
an official recantation,

229
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,180
{\an8}as well as the disclosure and destruction

230
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,516
{\an8}of all related documents.

231
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,142
Understood.

232
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,437
In consideration of the accused's
impressive academic record,

233
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,524
the Church is prepared to permit
university admission

234
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,901
if he agrees to our demands.

235
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,655
Will you accept the admission form?

236
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,825
<i>The important thing</i>

237
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,618
<i>is what to give up.</i>

238
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,412
<i>Choose correctly.</i>

239
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,373
<i>They're only words.</i>

240
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,667
<i>This will all work out.</i>

241
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,552
Now, please recant.

242
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,555
I hereby declare

243
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,975
that I believe in heliocentrism.

244
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,777
Why?

245
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,823
You allow prisoners
to drink such fine wine?

246
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,410
It's a special privilege
on the eve of torture.

247
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,328
I see.

248
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,415
Will you drink with me?

249
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,167
It's a shame to do so alone.

250
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,721
Why did you ruin our deal?

251
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,767
It's simple, really.

252
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,812
I thought not burning my materials
would aid heliocentrism.

253
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,564
There's no use.

254
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,357
Don't underestimate torture.

255
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,153
By tomorrow afternoon,
you'll have told us everything.

256
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,489
Your enemy is a resilient one.

257
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,077
The thing you all oppose isn't me.

258
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,870
Nor is it heretics.

259
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,831
It's part imagination

260
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,083
and part curiosity.

261
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,753
In short, it's truth itself.

262
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,838
Truth itself?

263
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,509
It spreads like an epidemic.

264
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,261
Not even the host can control it.

265
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,141
It's not the sort of harmless thing
that can be tamed by an organization.

266
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,685
So you're saying you'll win?

267
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,063
You think that

268
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,233
this is the right answer for your future?

269
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,486
Of course it's the wrong answer.

270
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,867
But a wrong answer
is not a meaningless one.

271
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,246
By the way,

272
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,833
do you know the effects of poppy seeds?

273
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,543
Poppy seeds?

274
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,461
Well...

275
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,257
It's said they were used
in ancient Athens.

276
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,843
If you mix them with poison,

277
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,471
simply put, they allow you
to die without pain.

278
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,683
I happen

279
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,686
to have added some just now.

280
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,068
Damn it!

281
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,866
- Not your cup.
- Huh?

282
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,076
The one who drank it was me.

283
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,994
Huh?

284
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,829
What?!

285
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,833
Y-You're lying.

286
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,002
You...

287
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,337
You're out of your mind!

288
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,423
You intend to die?

289
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,466
I guess.

290
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,719
Don't give me, "I guess"!

291
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,681
Besides, such a choice
violates our teachings!

292
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,475
How far will you go
to humiliate the Church?

293
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,562
{\an8}A terrifying fate
awaits you in the afterlife!

294
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,106
{\an8}No one knows what the afterlife is.

295
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,151
{\an8}To paraphrase Socrates,

296
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,361
{\an8}no one has experienced death,

297
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,615
{\an8}yet everyone assumes
it is the greatest evil.

298
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,326
Or as Epicurus said,

299
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,078
"When we exist, death is not;

300
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,789
and when death exists, we are not."

301
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,125
Or as Seneca said,

302
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,213
"Life is long if you know how to use it."

303
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,424
I agree with all of them.

304
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,012
Those things were said

305
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,014
by heathens from 2,000 years ago!

306
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,725
They had no absolute God or salvation!

307
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,477
What good are their words?!

308
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,563
They inspire me.

309
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,981
In...

310
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,778
Hubert died and disappeared.

311
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,865
But the inspiration
he left me hasn't faded.

312
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,785
I think inspiration

313
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,996
is probably more important than lifespan.

314
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,123
So faced with this choice,

315
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,835
I will let inspiration survive,

316
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,338
even if it costs me my own life.

317
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,384
You're out of your mind.

318
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,429
You're sacrificing your life
for something you don't understand.

319
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,723
Can't you see

320
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,226
how that is madness?

321
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,728
You're right.

322
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,441
But you could also call it "love."

323
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,412
Now then. May I ask to be alone?

324
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,707
Is it time already?

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,043
Yes. Bye now.

326
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,487
TEN YEARS LATER

327
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,748
It should be higher up.

328
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,920
Why is this happening to me?

329
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,518
{\an8}This...

330
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,977
This is it.

331
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,281
Earth?

332
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,917
