1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:08,008
25 YEARS LATER

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,468
Hey, you're late.

3
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,136
Forgive me.

4
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,221
The prisoner was not easy to capture.

5
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,850
So this is Schmidt?

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,685
Yes.

7
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,565
You men wait outside.

8
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,866
Now then.

9
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,078
I don't believe we've met, Schmidt.

10
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,916
Even so, I know all about
your organization.

11
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,627
The Heretic Liberation Front.

12
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,799
You've raided inquisition chambers
in every region and freed the heretics.

13
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,385
Your actions have become
a major source of worry.

14
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,054
Especially you, Schmidt.

15
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,723
Your squad is rather famous

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,185
for carrying out
that disgusting initiation test.

17
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,854
I'm sure you've been criticized

18
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,731
even within your organization.

19
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,275
Yet you don't seem fazed.

20
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,153
Is it your goal to kill God?

21
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,113
Well?

22
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,199
No.

23
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,701
You're the ones who kill God.

24
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,249
If I may be so presumptuous,
allow me to reply, inquisitor.

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,417
First,

26
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,129
I believe in God.

27
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,922
Second,

28
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,635
I aim to restore God to a state
unblemished by human ideas.

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,012
Third,

30
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:23,393
that goal requires the weakening
of the Church orthodoxy.

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,563
As I'm sure you know,

32
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,568
the authority of the Church's
orthodox wing has been wavering lately.

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,653
It's not only me.

34
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,406
The times are crying for change too.

35
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,077
Every word you utter
leaves me nauseous, you heretic.

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:47,125
By heretic, do you mean a member
of the faith who opposes church orthodoxy?

37
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,503
That's where we differ.

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,005
After all,

39
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,341
I reject all the church's teachings,
no matter which faction.

40
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:01,139
Or better put,
I reject all religions equally.

41
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,225
I'd like to see them all disappear.

42
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,311
What a load of nonsense.

43
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,730
What do you call yourself then?

44
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,066
A naturalist, I suppose?

45
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,444
A naturalist?

46
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,614
I worship those things where God resides.

47
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm not interested in anything man-made.

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,247
That's why I have no need
for your man-made teachings or salvation.

49
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,209
An artificial god is out of the question.

50
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,838
God exists beyond reason
and is found in nature.

51
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,467
So that's what makes you a "naturalist"?

52
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,930
You seem to have blind faith
in your own righteousness.

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,476
Do you realize how many people have died
from your misunderstanding?

54
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,312
Misunderstanding?

55
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,066
I disdain that word most of all.

56
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,735
How many have you killed

57
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,363
for interpreting
the Holy Scripture differently?

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,616
All with blind faith
in your own righteousness.

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,701
That's enough!

60
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,205
You can act defiant,
but you're our prisoner now.

61
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,915
You'll soon curse your own fate!

62
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,876
The very idea of cursing one's fate

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,213
comes from a lack of faith, inquisitor.

64
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,466
My god is absolute,

65
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:24,180
and my fate is determined
by what God deems most appropriate.

66
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,059
Unlike you, I don't pray to God

67
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,728
or hope for an answer.

68
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,108
I will gladly accept my fate,
no matter what it may be.

69
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,529
And that means I'm always at an advantage.

70
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,824
Words won't help you now!

71
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,497
In that case,
it's time to begin the operation.

72
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,773
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

73
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,049
{\an8}EPISODE 16
IT'S TIME TO BEGIN THE OPERATION

74
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,134
{\an8}In that case,
it's time to begin the operation.

75
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,803
{\an8}What?

76
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,517
What are you men doing?

77
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,894
I told you to wait outside!

78
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,937
It's no use.

79
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,151
They're with me.

80
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,739
Guards! There are traitors in our midst!

81
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,908
Y-You've got nowhere to run.

82
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,120
Even if you kill me,
the guards are coming!

83
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,372
We know.

84
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:59,752
After all, we didn't have time
to take them out beforehand.

85
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,004
Are you okay, sir?!

86
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,631
Phew.

87
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,009
You're outnumbered now.

88
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,888
I see. So this is all you have?

89
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,891
Then let's assess the situation.

90
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,020
There are three of us.

91
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,690
Meanwhile, there are ten of you.

92
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,610
I have three goals.

93
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,404
First,

94
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,406
overpower all of you.

95
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,450
Second,

96
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,995
break into the storeroom beneath your feet

97
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,913
and obtain a certain object.

98
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,957
Third,

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,584
escape from here.

100
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,421
However, it'd be a pain
to leave through the main gate,

101
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,048
so we'll create a new exit.

102
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,758
An exit?

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,971
Now that I think about it,
it's a very difficult task.

104
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,724
Indeed.

105
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,726
If you understand, then surrender now.

106
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,854
That won't do.

107
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,691
Instead, I propose
an ingenious, sophisticated,

108
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,904
precisely crafted,
and innovative solution.

109
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,783
Have you all heard of explosives?

110
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,287
That must be a no.

111
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,875
I figured foot soldiers like yourselves
had already heard the rumors,

112
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,043
but I guess not.

113
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,588
Even I'm not well-versed in their history,

114
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,883
but it's said they come from the East.

115
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,261
I've heard that weapons
applying their formula

116
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,264
were used in the recent factional wars.

117
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,645
Their preparation involves
mixing three ingredients.

118
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,105
Well, I'll skip the details.

119
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,150
To put it simply,

120
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,237
all three of the challenges we face

121
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,113
can be blown away with this.

122
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,865
Blown away?

123
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,639
There's that smoke again.

124
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,601
Even so, you mixed them well, Frei.

125
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,981
To master a difficult science
like the creation of explosives

126
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,983
is truly impressive.

127
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,401
Thank you.

128
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,446
And you did well to carry
such heavy materials, Lewandowski.

129
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,909
Huh? Is that all I get praise for?

130
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,744
Forgive me.

131
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,205
Now then...

132
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,720
Pardon me.

133
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,439
{\an8}Let's get ahold of what we came for...

134
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,030
and move the Earth.

135
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,330
Who are they?

136
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:27,126
These are the heretics we liberated
while you spoke with the inquisitor.

137
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,130
They wish to join the Liberation Front.

138
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,840
I see.

139
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,176
Forgive me.

140
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,763
We usually welcome new recruits
right after liberation,

141
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,849
but my squad has all we need.

142
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,476
Another time...

143
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,560
We knew that!

144
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,478
Oh?

145
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:50,232
But it's because of you
that we wish to join, Captain Schmidt!

146
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,692
We've heard rumors

147
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,987
about the many heretics you've liberated.

148
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,158
We know how you've risked your life
in the fight for freedom.

149
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,745
Please let us join you!

150
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,123
Oh my, what an honor.

151
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,253
If you're that determined,
we'll give you the initiation test.

152
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,631
The Holy Scripture.

153
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,548
Yes, sir.

154
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,259
Initiation test?

155
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,599
As you know, this book
has been your moral support,

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,228
the backbone of your daily life,
and the foundation of society.

157
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,814
There's only one thing I ask of you.

158
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,108
Declare you don't believe in it.

159
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,944
Huh?

160
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,654
What?!

161
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,408
Indeed. I understand your hesitancy.

162
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,453
But we're not asking as a casual request.

163
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,916
You must be ready
to change everything from now on.

164
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,043
{\an8}I promise you this.

165
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,880
{\an8}If you join me, you will gain
true order and a true god.

166
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:00,261
However, you cannot bring along
your man-made order and god.

167
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,763
There are only two choices.

168
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,141
Everything else is luxury.

169
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,647
Say we don't believe
in the Holy Scripture?

170
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,817
Surely you must be joking.

171
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,571
Our dispute is only
with the Church orthodoxy,

172
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,656
not with the Church itself.

173
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,575
That includes the Holy Scripture.

174
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:27,455
Doesn't the Liberation Front
share those same beliefs?

175
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,914
That's correct.

176
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,418
But I'm different.

177
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,713
Are you disappointed?

178
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,759
It seems only the positive rumors
about me have spread.

179
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,512
Is destruction like this necessary?

180
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,349
{\an8}You could say that destruction
is <i>all</i> that is necessary.

181
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,730
All impure man-made frameworks
must be thoroughly destroyed,

182
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,942
and we must live modestly
in the natural world that is God's order.

183
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,989
That's what is best
for humans as living things.

184
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,076
B-But then we'd be nothing more
than ignorant animals!

185
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,453
Exactly!

186
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,123
In fact, humans are not
so different from animals.

187
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,543
We don't have the capacity
to handle truth appropriately.

188
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,088
Half-truths lead to misunderstanding,

189
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,841
and misunderstanding leads to tragedy.

190
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,260
I can accept tragedies born from nature,

191
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,598
but unnatural tragedies
caused by humans must not be tolerated.

192
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,061
If you agree with me, then declare it now.

193
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,107
I... I can't do it!

194
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,484
I could never do it!

195
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,069
Well done!

196
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,238
I respect your decision!

197
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,950
However, we may fight
to the death at some point.

198
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,452
Let's both be ready for that.

199
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,664
Farewell.

200
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:02,216
Captain, this seems to be
what we came for.

201
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,343
Oh, is that so?

202
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,428
So this is the book?

203
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,683
Yes. I had a look inside just now.

204
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,853
It definitely states that the Earth moves.

205
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,856
What about the names Oczy or Badeni?

206
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,858
Oczy?

207
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,110
No, I haven't seen those yet.

208
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,820
I see.

209
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,990
Say, what are we gonna do
with that book anyway?

210
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,617
We'll bring it to the leader.

211
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,078
I can't tell you everything until then.

212
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,664
Where is our leader now?

213
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,583
I can't say until we arrive.

214
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,668
Same as always, huh?

215
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,546
But according to the leader,

216
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,466
this is the Liberation Front's
most important mission.

217
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,012
We must accomplish it.

218
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,140
Look!

219
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,559
I see it!

220
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,854
It's the abandoned village!

221
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,900
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

222
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,817
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

223
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,949
25 YEARS EARLIER

224
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,538
Is that all of them?

225
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,081
Yes.

226
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,236
There you are, dear.

227
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,238
We're ready.

228
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,156
Let's go.

229
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,956
What were those people doing?

230
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,500
They've misunderstood.

231
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,628
H-Hey!

232
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,175
Brother...

233
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,719
I saw you weren't at home.

234
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,764
What are you doing out here at this hour?

235
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,307
Uncle!

236
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,642
Oh, it's you.

237
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,102
Don't scare me like that.

238
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,940
I'm sorry to say so,
but our village has gone mad.

239
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,818
How could they burn the crosses?

240
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,363
Will you go elsewhere then?

241
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,908
Yes, that's right. Will you join us?

242
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,202
No, I can't.

243
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,666
Sorry, kid.

244
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,584
You're hungry, aren't you?

245
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,462
That goes for me too.

246
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,466
Tell me something, Brother.

247
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,886
Why is it that we're so poor?

248
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,014
Why ask that now?

249
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,057
The nobility fights,

250
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,601
and we peasants dedicate our harvest.

251
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,103
That's the way things are.

252
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,272
I don't have time for chatter!

253
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,276
Yes, I understand that.

254
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,863
The nobility do their part.

255
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,367
But what I don't understand is the clergy.

256
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,205
Remember what we were taught?

257
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,916
"It is easier for a camel

258
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,920
to go through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter heaven."

259
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,133
Be diligent. Be humble.

260
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,843
Live a modest life.

261
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,304
Do so, and you will be saved.

262
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,640
It's because we believe those teachings

263
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,893
that we pay tithes to the Church.

264
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,897
{\an8}But what about them?

265
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,941
{\an8}They preach about honorable poverty

266
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,986
{\an8}and fill their bellies with our tithes.

267
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,614
{\an8}They pass out drunk at taverns,

268
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,159
{\an8}and some even use their money
to buy poor children.

269
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,495
Y-You...

270
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,414
Tell me, Brother.

271
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,419
Why do churches need
all those lavish decorations?

272
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,715
Why must the faithful be divided by class?

273
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:18,305
Why do we have to stay quiet
and accept things as they are?

274
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,561
Y-You're right to point those things out.

275
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,190
But if our village uses
such violent means,

276
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,609
divisions within the Church
will only grow!

277
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,278
{\an8}At this rate, our village...

278
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,322
{\an8}All of us will be labeled heretics.

279
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,244
{\an8}I see. So that's your answer.

280
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,705
It seems we can't agree.

281
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,509
- Dear!
- Run!

282
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,401
Why... don't you get it over with?

283
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,988
I'm giving you time.

284
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,868
Time to understand your own shallowness.

285
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,203
Time to experience despair.

286
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,415
And finally, time to repent.

287
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,586
It's not too late.

288
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,380
Say you were mistaken.

289
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,886
{\an8}Say that the Church orthodoxy is mistaken!

290
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,053
{\an8}Say it now!

291
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,934
Save... our child...

292
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,609
He's dead.

293
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,841
{\an8}Run!

294
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,218
You bitch!

295
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,971
Mother!

296
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,474
Run!

297
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,351
Let go!

298
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,335
According to the leader,
there should be supplies here.

299
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,921
Let's rest and replenish.

300
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,298
Damn it.

301
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,843
Every village we find
is dead from the plague!

302
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,096
It's enough to make you heartsick.

303
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,473
But I guess we can use them
for our missions.

304
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,808
Yeah.

305
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,269
And you're really loud, you know?

306
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,729
Huh? Does that matter now?

307
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,064
No.

308
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,904
Okay, we can use this place.

309
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,492
Frei, continue confirming
the contents of the book.

310
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,828
We'll gather the supplies.

311
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,496
Yes, sir.

312
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,249
Huh?

313
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,669
According to the map, it should be...

314
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,589
Someone's here.

315
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,931
<i>Man... What a weird book.</i>

316
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>What exactly was it written for?</i>

317
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,564
<i>And what does the leader want with it?</i>

318
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,529
Who are you? What are you doing here?

319
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,450
I'm resting.

320
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,328
You're here to pillage the ruins.

321
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,829
Come with me.

322
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,998
I'll hand you over to the Bishop.

323
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,833
Fine. Let's go.

324
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,586
Please calm yourself.

325
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,176
Where did you come from?

326
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,218
What's your name?

327
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,595
That's...

328
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,479
Forgive me, Captain.

329
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,481
Where's the book?

330
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,816
I hid it in a drawer in that house.

331
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,444
Let's get it and leave.

332
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,781
It seems the Church's minions are here.

333
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,241
Hey! Who's there?

334
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,995
Damn it. What do we do now?

335
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,122
The book is safely hidden.

336
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,085
I believe the wise choice
is to regroup and collect it later.

337
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,129
{\an8}Let's do that.

338
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,464
{\an8}Halt!

339
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,974
W-We let the intruders escape,

340
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,310
Bishop Antoni...

341
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,815
It's fine. They're not important.

342
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,857
Let them be.

343
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,948
I think this one offers us a lot more.

344
