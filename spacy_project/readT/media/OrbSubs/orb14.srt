1
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,132
Where are the documents?

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,178
I told you. I burned them!

3
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,731
Where?

4
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,859
What idiocy.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,155
It's useless to demand
evidence that doesn't exist!

6
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,291
Where are the documents?

7
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,753
Why are you doing this?

8
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,255
Please proceed to the next stage.

9
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,175
Execute us, or whatever else
you have planned!

10
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,930
{\an8}This is absurd!

11
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,727
{\an8}If you keep asking the same questions,
the torture will never--

12
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,147
{\an8}Wait, I see.

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,733
So that's your plan.

14
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:12,072
You want revenge on us
for approaching your daughter.

15
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,784
This is your only chance

16
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,494
to torment us legally!

17
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,083
{\an8}But are such personal grudges

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,126
{\an8}proper for a believer?

19
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,921
Quit running your mouth.

20
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,090
Where are the documents?

21
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,809
If you don't answer,

22
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,061
he'll be torn from cheek to cheek.

23
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,650
I... I told you. I burned them.

24
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,780
Sir, isn't this going too far?

25
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,281
No.

26
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,617
Treat him later,

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,577
so he'll be able to speak.

28
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,495
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,289
If the mouth won't do...

30
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,415
Huh?

31
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,419
Then next up is the eyes.

32
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,738
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

33
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,060
{\an8}EPISODE 14
TONIGHT'S SKY...

34
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,563
Stop this immediately.

35
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,150
Even if you do this,

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,194
it won't bring back what I burned.

37
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,530
This isn't faith!

38
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,539
Do I look like I'm here for small talk?

39
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,004
Five more breaths,
and I'll pierce his eye.

40
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,923
- Hold it open.
- Huh?

41
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,058
M-Maybe they really burned them?

42
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,559
Five...

43
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,815
Four...

44
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:41,114
Right now, I want to see
Venus in its final phase.

45
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,490
Three...

46
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,995
I've been waiting
for such a special instant!

47
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,246
Two...

48
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,083
Now then. May God bless you.

49
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,878
One...

50
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,549
Damn it!

51
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,428
You're right.

52
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,014
Everything I said was a lie.

53
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,267
The materials are preserved.

54
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,146
They're in a stone chest
on a certain mountain slope.

55
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,274
Oh? Then take us there.

56
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,609
Very well.

57
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,739
I'm sorry... Oczy.

58
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,454
I'm grateful to you both
for your cooperation.

59
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,664
Get some rest.

60
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,252
We've finally reached the end.

61
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,260
It looks like you were telling the truth.

62
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:52,352
I'm glad you're a conventional thinker.

63
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,982
After all, the one who left
this chest behind ten years ago

64
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,527
poisoned himself to death to protect it.

65
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,657
It seems you weren't the type
to go that far.

66
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,869
- What kind...
- Huh?

67
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,248
Just what kind of person was he?

68
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,753
I thought you had no interest
in your predecessors.

69
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,176
Well, he was largely the same
as you and all the other heretics.

70
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,973
He threw his entire life away
for the sake of some ridiculous belief.

71
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,729
But what set him apart

72
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,400
was that he was only 12 years old.

73
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,693
That's absurd!

74
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,737
A 12-year-old?

75
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,948
Surprising, right?

76
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,324
Yes.

77
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,120
Then again, it finally makes sense.

78
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,040
Only a 12-year-old

79
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,709
would dare to move the world.

80
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:10,888
{\an8}Evening.

81
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,235
Did they get ahold of the stone chest?

82
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,153
Yes.

83
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,406
Are you angry?

84
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,283
Of course not.

85
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,287
You always said we'd leave nothing behind.

86
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,248
Actually, I'm surprised.

87
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,418
You really did save the documents.

88
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,045
And you tried to protect them.

89
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,174
Yeah, I'm as surprised as you.

90
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,679
Why did you confess everything?

91
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,682
We're going to die anyway.

92
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,934
Who cares about my eyes--

93
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,478
You don't get it.

94
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,316
{\an8}Do you have any idea how painful that is?

95
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,863
It's time.

96
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,782
Put these on and come out.

97
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,246
It's strange...

98
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,332
I've seen it many times,

99
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,375
but when your own time comes,

100
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,836
it doesn't feel real.

101
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,506
What doesn't?

102
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,633
{\an8}Death.

103
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,802
They've been strange days,

104
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,057
but they're all coming to an end.

105
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,729
I heard the age

106
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,398
of the one who first owned that chest.

107
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,068
How old do you think he was?

108
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,028
Beats me.

109
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,780
He was 12.

110
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,240
Huh? Twelve?!

111
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,867
But that's impossible.

112
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,410
Yeah.

113
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,329
And that means

114
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,207
the unexpected can happen.

115
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,296
Heliocentrism is not dead yet.

116
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,422
What?

117
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,508
I told you in the barn.

118
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,552
I had a backup plan.

119
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,138
But whether it works or not
depends on luck.

120
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,642
There's no time to explain the details,

121
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,852
but if all goes well,

122
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,646
the writing will be reproduced.

123
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,274
But how?

124
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,859
When could all that writing of yours--

125
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,570
Not mine.

126
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,612
What?

127
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,322
The writing that will survive

128
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,449
is yours.

129
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,410
What?!

130
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,454
- M-Mine?
- Yes.

131
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,000
B-But why?

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,710
Have you forgotten?

133
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,506
I had no intention of handing
my work to someone else.

134
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,175
Yeah, but--

135
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,677
And in any case,

136
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,514
my writing
was too voluminous to reproduce.

137
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,184
Your writing has no scholarly value,

138
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,770
but that's why it might spread.

139
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,065
What might spread?

140
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,693
Inspiration.

141
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,488
If that alone survives,

142
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,033
the rest will take care of itself.

143
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,914
But leaving something behind
won't be beneficial to you, right?

144
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,417
You're damn right.

145
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,463
Leaving something behind
in the hands of perfect strangers

146
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,674
is meaningless-- no, worthless to me!

147
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,887
However, mysteriously enough,

148
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,932
there may be a realm
that doesn't deem it useless.

149
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,477
For example...

150
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,483
that thing you call history.

151
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,321
Anyway, let's go.

152
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,239
It's time.

153
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,245
In the name of our Lord,

154
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,666
we condemn thee.

155
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,089
Thou hath betrayed
the teachings of the Church

156
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,260
and sullied thyselves
through heretical research.

157
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,932
About your plan...

158
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,849
Huh?

159
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,769
What do you think the chances are

160
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,562
that it will work?

161
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,315
Infinitesimally low.

162
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,318
That's wonderful.

163
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,277
What?

164
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,280
My life ends with hope intact.

165
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,368
{\an8}The end of life?

166
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,370
Well,

167
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,581
we are standing at the entrance to hell.

168
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,793
No.

169
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,088
Well, we're at an entrance all right.

170
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,006
But it's...

171
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,426
To the heavens.

172
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,888
{\an8}Do you really think so?

173
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,515
{\an8}Yes.

174
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,435
The sight that spreads before us now

175
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,521
doesn't look like the entrance to hell.

176
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,984
{\an8}Tonight's sky

177
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,694
{\an8}is definitely...

178
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,114
beautiful.

179
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,622
I guess I can believe in that.

180
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,880
We pray that thee be granted
the sacrament of penance.

181
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,098
<i>Because history needs you.</i>

182
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,435
<i>But even if I die...
this world will continue.</i>

183
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,854
<i>That means I can pass the torch.</i>

184
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:57,026
What if our world really does move?

185
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,528
I've decided to let you view my records.

186
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,739
However, I have one condition.

187
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,451
{\an8}You must prove true
what I know to be false.

188
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,043
<i>See it.</i>

189
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,462
<i>Look full.</i>

190
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,216
Okay... Go ahead and burn them.

191
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,018
ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

192
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:13,936
<i>Orb.</i>

193
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,902
Hey, what do you think faith is?

194
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,820
Huh?

195
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,323
Faith... or the Church...

196
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,869
Well, it's scripture, of course.
Or doctrine and things.

197
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,288
Why the sudden question?

198
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,500
Sometimes, I lose sight of the answer.

199
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,005
<i>We spend every day
inflicting pain on others.</i>

200
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,884
Yeah, but they're heretics and witches.

201
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,385
They're evil, right?

202
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,637
Yeah. You're right.

203
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,601
So, why is my heart so heavy?

204
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,814
It's the scholars' job
to think about that.

205
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,860
Our job now is to carry out
what our superiors decide.

206
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,862
Hey, there she is.

207
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,575
Let's get to work.

208
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,621
What can I do for you?

209
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,292
Hello, are you Jolenta?

210
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,293
Yes.

211
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,505
We're apprentices of your father.

212
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,008
Is that so?

213
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,844
I'm embarrassed to say it,

214
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,263
but I don't know much
about my father's work.

215
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,476
What is it that you do?

216
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,062
Th-That's, uh...

217
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,567
We're inquisitors.

218
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:47,947
What?

219
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,115
Inquisitors?

220
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,450
Yes.

221
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,870
And we were hoping to speak with you.

222
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,338
So, what is this about?

223
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,842
Don't worry. We're not here
to arrest you or anything.

224
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,971
We heard from your father.

225
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,142
Six nights ago,
you had dinner with friends, right?

226
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,563
I believe your father visited you there.

227
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,275
The other two men
have been judged as heretics.

228
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,278
To be precise,

229
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:33,117
they researched a model of the universe
that defies church doctrine.

230
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,453
Do you happen to remember

231
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,789
hearing anything suspicious like that?

232
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,544
If we happen to be arrested in the future,

233
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,879
pretend you know nothing.

234
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,924
No.

235
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,427
I don't know a thing.

236
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,013
Is that so?

237
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,932
But please try and remember.

238
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,059
You seemed quite acquainted.

239
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,937
Did they ever ask
for your help with something?

240
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,940
No, nothing like that.

241
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,070
Well, that's only natural.

242
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,866
The daughter of an inquisitor
assisting a heretic...

243
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,576
It's too far-fetched.

244
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,998
You two, may I have a moment?

245
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,250
A-Antoni!

246
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,210
Over here.

247
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,799
What is it?

248
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,594
Is that Nowak's daughter in there?

249
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,097
Yes. She had contact
with the two heretics,

250
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,599
so just in case...

251
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,437
But she doesn't appear to know anything,

252
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,522
so we were about to let her go.

253
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,149
Oh?

254
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,861
Then prepare her for torture.

255
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,987
- What?!
- What?!

256
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,615
Think clearly.

257
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,618
The very fact that a woman
sought to be a scholar

258
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,496
is suspicious enough.

259
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,958
I suspect that she's the leader.

260
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,838
Or rather, the demon
that possesses her is.

261
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,218
The two arrested men
were surely just puppets.

262
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,929
You must get to the truth.

263
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,306
B-But sir,

264
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,350
her father is an inquisitor!

265
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,479
The stricter the home,
the greater the temptation.

266
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,398
We've seen many cases of that.

267
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,316
But--

268
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,693
Oh, right. You're the one.

269
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,612
I heard, you know.

270
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,865
You refused to torture a woman
during your training.

271
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,245
And didn't she turn out to be guilty?

272
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,665
Will you let another villain get away?

273
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,293
Unbelievable.

274
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,131
Do you know how much the Church spends

275
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,549
to train new inquisitors?

276
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,386
You'd better give this some thought.

277
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,307
What impressions do your words
and actions leave with others?

278
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,270
And what effect
will that have on your future?

279
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,107
If you understand, get to work.

280
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,905
Excuse me.

281
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,701
{\an8}Huh?

282
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,452
What?!

283
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,372
These are fine gloves.

284
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,000
H-Hey!

285
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,210
What is the meaning of this?

286
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,546
We're going to interrogate you.

287
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,465
What? Interrogate?

288
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,009
That's right.

289
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,136
About those two heretics?

290
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:43,015
I told them already.
I don't know anything!

291
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,892
Everyone says that at first.

292
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,354
If you don't answer honestly,

293
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,565
we'll pull your teeth.

294
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,734
Women like to chatter, right?

295
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,403
It's said you're in league with the devil

296
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,406
and use your tongues to spread ruin.

297
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,576
That's implausible reasoning.

298
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,827
Please take it back.

299
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,621
See what I mean?

300
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,666
Now, get going.

301
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,836
- What?
- But...

302
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,713
Come on, you can't be serious.

303
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,090
Are you two really inquisitors?

304
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,930
Fine. I get it.

305
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,109
There. I took the first step for you.

306
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,657
I'll leave the rest to you.

307
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,373
Kids these days are too spoiled.

308
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,173
P-Please don't!

309
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,383
This is...

310
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,635
We have our orders.

311
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,679
We have to obey.

312
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,902
Why don't we use the thumb screw?

313
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,028
What?

314
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,738
I don't want to see her face.

315
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,907
R-Right.

316
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,159
I agree. I'll go get it.

317
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,665
{\an8}The tables have finally turned
in my favor.

318
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,004
We'll be rid of him now.

319
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,801
If his daughter is judged a heretic,
Nowak is finished.

320
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,930
It's what he deserves
for currying favor with the Bishop

321
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,640
all this time.

322
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,727
Once Nowak is disgraced,

323
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,230
the Bishop's reputation
will suffer by association.

324
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,318
I'll be a more important figure than ever.

325
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,448
This is our chance
to correct the Church's course.

326
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,409
We can't make a living being passive.

327
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,746
Indeed! We're with you!

328
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,041
Did you bring it?

329
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,336
Sorry, I forgot where it's stored.

330
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,089
Could you get it instead?

331
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,177
Huh? Oh, uh... sure.

332
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,107
You have to run! You'll be killed!

333
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,735
Huh? What?!

334
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,614
H-Hey!

335
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,668
This way! Come on!

336
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,420
Wait, um...

337
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,298
I can't let them kill you!

338
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,426
I'll stay behind
and explain to the others.

339
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,553
I'm sure they'll understand.

340
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,265
Why are you doing this?

341
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,356
What do you think faith is?

342
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,358
Huh?

343
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,195
I believe

344
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,738
it's a way of life.

345
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,957
