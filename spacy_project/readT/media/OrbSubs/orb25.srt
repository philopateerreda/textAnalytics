1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,588
Who are we?

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,676
I've no doubt that we are those
who will inherit the coming age.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,764
Having broken free of the prejudices
and discrimination of old,

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,143
we will freely, nimbly, and elegantly

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,812
plunge into the unknown.

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,858
And today, a new comrade
has joined our quest.

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,818
His name is Albert.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,445
Welcome!

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,572
We're glad to have you!

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,784
I've served as his tutor,

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,370
and his clear thinking has amazed me.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,331
It's as if a master theoretician

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,959
has entered into a young boy's body.

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,047
However, what I find even more remarkable

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,215
is his intense curiosity.

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,551
No other talent

17
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,304
is more important
to the future of academia.

18
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,683
I say that because I am afraid.

19
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,061
Perhaps in the future,

20
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,440
the view that truth is conceived,
rather than discovered,

21
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,110
{\an8}may become an assumption of sorts.

22
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,530
Written works of the past
and other countries

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,409
all describe different histories,
cultures, and faiths.

24
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,496
Information is in short supply now,

25
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,625
but if we connect with those
foreign to us in the days to come,

26
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,087
even truth may one day
be seen as relative.

27
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,298
When that happens,

28
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,426
awe and admiration
for the ideal of universal truth

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,970
may fade from human hearts.

30
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,184
As a result, research will become
increasingly specialized.

31
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,896
The grand desire for contact
with knowledge as a whole,

32
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,148
in other words, curiosity itself,

33
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,611
may be despised as frivolous and wasteful.

34
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,364
If that happens,

35
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,242
I can't help but feel sad.

36
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,704
That's why I choose

37
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,998
{\an8}to believe.

38
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,917
{\an8}I believe in all of you

39
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,169
and your curiosity.

40
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,508
Here's to your curiosity
and that of our newest member!

41
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,927
Cheers!

42
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,929
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

43
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,749
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

44
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,194
Oh man, I spoke too long again.

45
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,904
Um, excuse me.

46
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,698
Thank you again.

47
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,742
I don't know what to say,

48
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,162
but I'm very happy
that you invited me here!

49
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,791
Don't be so humble.

50
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,834
We're equals here.

51
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,297
Anyway, I have an errand to attend to,
so I'll take my leave.

52
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,924
But you should enjoy yourself.

53
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,804
They're probably discussing cosmology
at that table over there.

54
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,348
It should interest you.

55
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,434
Cosmology?

56
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,356
You came all the way here,

57
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,276
so it would be a shame if you left early.

58
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,403
Be sure to stay until the end.

59
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,321
Yes, of course!

60
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,240
Well then, see you later.

61
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,999
That's where the secret information
I obtained comes in.

62
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,584
A prominent man named Ibn al-Shatir

63
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,087
adopted the stance of the Maragha scholars

64
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,339
and refined the uniform motion
of Ptolemy's--

65
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,799
- Oh!
- Huh?

66
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,509
Sorry, it's nothing!

67
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,969
Please continue.

68
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,765
Right. Anyway, what Ibn al-Shatir did was...

69
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,017
<i>Oh, no.</i>

70
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,271
<i>I forgot to record my observations today.</i>

71
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,648
<i>What do I do?</i>

72
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,109
<i>If I go home now,</i>

73
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,862
<i>the meeting will be over
by the time I get back.</i>

74
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,823
<i>Then again, this is a special day.</i>

75
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>It won't hurt if I skip
my observations just this once.</i>

76
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,747
...there's another way to look at it.

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,999
- Huh?
- Sorry, I have to go.

78
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,293
Thank you very much for today!

79
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,836
Huh? Sure.

80
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,087
Come again, okay?

81
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,922
I will. Farewell!

82
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,763
<i>If I'm lucky,</i>

83
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,599
<i>I can borrow Father's horse
and go back right away.</i>

84
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,768
<i>I might make it in time!</i>

85
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,981
I'm back!

86
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,170
Huh?

87
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,505
Oh, my.

88
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:25,176
Huh? W-What are you...

89
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,719
Oh, uh...

90
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
Man, this is a dilemma.

91
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,934
Well, I understand how you feel.

92
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,394
You must be confused.

93
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,147
Even so, I'd like you to stay calm.

94
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,566
If you deal with it rationally,

95
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,902
this too can be understood.

96
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,154
I have faith in you.

97
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,076
Let me say first

98
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,289
that I never intended this to happen.

99
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,709
I wanted to settle things peacefully.

100
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,006
Anyway, I'll start from the beginning.

101
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,552
Recently, I heard a rumor

102
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,681
that your father possessed
certain materials.

103
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,893
These materials deal
with a revolutionary theory

104
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,354
that could change
the shape of the universe.

105
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:23,109
I've been interested in that theory
for as long as I can remember,

106
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:27,238
but I had given up hope
of ever tracking it down.

107
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,825
I thought I had finally found
an entry point.

108
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,078
So I proposed sharing the materials

109
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,955
and engaging in joint research.

110
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,833
It wasn't a bad offer, I'd say.

111
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,294
To be honest,

112
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,214
the theory is beyond your father's grasp.

113
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,177
Without my intellect and social position,

114
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,345
its value will be lost.

115
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,433
I would have compensated him fairly,

116
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,602
and we both would have benefited.

117
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,272
But that's when the problem started.

118
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,108
He refused my offer.

119
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,943
Without a second thought.

120
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,487
Instead,

121
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,907
he insisted that the theory
conflicted with the prevailing models

122
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,242
and that it might be suppressed.

123
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,746
"I have a child.
I can't take on anything dangerous."

124
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,955
Those were his words.

125
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,626
He was an awfully fussy man.

126
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,963
With the right political moves,
suppression can easily be avoided.

127
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,382
But he wouldn't listen.

128
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,469
<i>No, it was worse than that.</i>

129
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,888
<i>When I tried to convince him,</i>

130
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,556
<i>he grew angry.</i>

131
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,976
<i>In the end, he said
he would burn the materials.</i>

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,396
I have to say,

133
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,190
that left me speechless.

134
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,401
Despite all his talk
of knowledge and learning,

135
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,072
he was a boor
concerned only with self-preservation.

136
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,493
Oh, I guess I shouldn't
speak ill of your father.

137
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,370
I take that back. Sorry.

138
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,706
In any case, he grew hysterical,

139
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,084
and I thought he might
do something drastic.

140
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,711
And so, I pacified him.

141
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,296
In the only way I could.

142
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,840
Your father

143
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,385
kept knowledge to himself
and refused to share.

144
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,887
That is an intolerable sin.

145
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,974
That way of thinking must be eliminated.

146
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,601
Understand?

147
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,895
The important thing here

148
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,482
is that the knowledge
your father inherited

149
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,693
will no longer be lost.

150
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,279
To pursue the beauty of this world,

151
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,447
sacrifices are unavoidable.

152
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,201
Now then, that clears things up, right?

153
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,124
{\an8}In the end,

154
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,085
{\an8}just as he finished his speech,

155
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,337
{\an8}he was captured by the townspeople.

156
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,007
{\an8}I don't know the rest.

157
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,051
{\an8}It's ridiculous, right?

158
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,928
{\an8}It all meant so little.

159
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,265
<i>My father</i>

160
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,100
<i>told me to doubt.</i>

161
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,604
{\an8}As a result, he trusted no one

162
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,565
{\an8}and was killed
for not sharing his materials.

163
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,151
<i>My teacher</i>

164
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,986
<i>told me to believe.</i>

165
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,198
As a result,
he had such faith in his convictions

166
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,159
that he didn't question murder.

167
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,496
That's the fate of people
who deal with knowledge.

168
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,542
"Truth" and "learning"
are too big a burden for humans.

169
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,337
That's why university

170
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,839
is a fool's path.

171
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,218
Do you have to choose between them?

172
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,261
Huh?

173
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,305
Doubt and conviction.

174
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,891
Would it hurt to have both?

175
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,894
Yes, it would.

176
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,396
They contradict each other.

177
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,691
St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that knowledge

178
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,194
is both material

179
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,030
and immaterial.

180
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,659
Body and soul.

181
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,702
Reason and faith.

182
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,080
Philosophy and theology.

183
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,666
Doubt and belief.

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,585
These contradictions coexist.

185
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,128
Why?

186
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,048
Because we're human.

187
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,136
Human beings are neither God nor beast.

188
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,263
They exist between the two.

189
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,641
But that's exactly why

190
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:28,646
they can accept contradiction,
ambiguity, and confusion.

191
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,692
In fact, such things provide
a breather from reason.

192
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,319
Listening to you,

193
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,656
it seems that you no longer
feel God's presence.

194
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,783
In other words,

195
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,869
you no longer sense what a miracle it is

196
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,329
that our world exists.

197
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:52,545
Miracles are chance phenomena
that occur when inevitability rules.

198
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,255
At the same time,

199
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,759
they are also inevitable phenomena
that occur when chance rules.

200
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,514
You felt those things back then.

201
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,852
{\an8}<i>You knew that everything
in this world is a miracle.</i>

202
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,857
But as you cast aside
experience and memory,

203
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,111
your past and roots,
and finally pain itself,

204
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,155
you also lost the miraculous.

205
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:24,160
Even though that realm
is where you truly belong.

206
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,496
That's not for you to decide.

207
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,041
Do you know what you should do?

208
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,877
I don't have a clue.

209
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,171
It's simple.

210
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,214
Look up at the sky.

211
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,050
And then, take a deep breath.

212
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,638
My problems aren't that simple.

213
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,015
Of course not.

214
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,269
But even so, they are not insurmountable.

215
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,106
Letters to the Corinthians,

216
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,442
Chapter 10, Verse 13.

217
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,570
"God is faithful;

218
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,824
and he will not let you
be tempted beyond your ability,

219
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,286
but with the temptation

220
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,998
he will also provide the way of escape,
that you may be able to endure it."

221
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,212
Now then,

222
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,048
you showed the courage to speak,

223
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,551
so I will confess my own secret worry.

224
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,138
In my case...

225
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,226
Long ago,

226
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,729
I left a friend for dead.

227
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,609
In the course of his work,

228
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,320
my friend committed a terrible crime.

229
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,740
Something irreversible.

230
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,076
As a result,

231
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,161
he died.

232
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,207
But it was the very severity of his sin

233
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,836
that made it important
to show him the path of salvation.

234
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,965
What was the correct choice
for me at that moment?

235
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,592
I still have no answer.

236
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,303
I don't know if I ever will.

237
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,641
However, one thing is clear.

238
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,768
Before today,

239
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,980
I had turned a blind eye to my past.

240
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,861
But now I was able to express it
in words for the first time.

241
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,282
By doing so, I'll probably suffer
even more from now on.

242
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,952
But at the same time,

243
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,580
I'll believe today was a first step.

244
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,416
The same goes for you.

245
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,544
You told me your worries.

246
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,963
Now you can move forward.

247
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,800
God will accept us.

248
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:50,222
And God will always offer us a refuge.

249
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,808
{\an8}But for that to happen,

250
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,895
{\an8}we must overcome ourselves

251
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,981
and face God with sincerity.

252
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,858
In addition,

253
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,277
we must question in solitude

254
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:10,326
whether we are worthy of God's acceptance.

255
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,288
But no matter how much
we struggle with that question,

256
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,248
God will remain silent.

257
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,833
That's right.

258
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,252
And that's what enables us

259
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,005
to continue thinking, without end.

260
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,343
I'd like to believe that is happiness.

261
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,681
Finally,

262
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,225
I have one question for you.

263
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,855
To obtain bread, one offers coin.

264
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,485
To obtain rights, one offers taxes.

265
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,864
To obtain wages, one offers labor.

266
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,533
So then,

267
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,953
what must one offer up

268
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,080
to obtain the truth of our world?

269
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,374
What do you think?

270
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,756
Go in search of the answer.

271
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,884
Why?

272
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,471
So you can resume living in this world.

273
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,438
<i>I think going to university</i>

274
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,273
<i>might be one way to find out.</i>

275
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,777
<i>Farewell, and may God bless you.</i>

276
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,604
To pursue the beauty of this world,
sacrifices are unavoidable.

277
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,151
No matter what happens,

278
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,112
I'll never criticize your curiosity.

279
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,642
Teacher,

280
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,521
I want to pursue the beauty of this world.

281
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,109
To do so, sacrifices are unavoidable.

282
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,696
To be honest,

283
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,364
I feel the same way.

284
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,826
<i>But you couldn't reach beauty</i>

285
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,288
with the methods you chose.

286
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,084
I don't know what must be offered up

287
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,795
to know the truth of this world.

288
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,255
{\an8}But I'm certain

289
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,968
{\an8}that hiding things like my father
or eliminating others like you

290
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,971
{\an8}is not how it's done.

291
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,682
We all lack something.

292
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,768
That's why we work together.

293
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,355
The world is too big
of a challenge otherwise.

294
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,859
Humans are social animals.

295
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,904
Teacher,

296
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,657
I too feel <i>thaumazein</i>.

297
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
I will continue to affirm that feeling

298
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,663
in ways different from you.

299
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,500
I'll doubt as I move forward

300
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,919
and believe as I turn back.

301
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,130
My pursuit of beauty

302
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,090
and inspiration

303
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,551
will never end.

304
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,019
Oh, you're back.

305
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,730
- That took longer than expected.
- Master!

306
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,317
Please allow me to attend university.

307
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,198
Let's see.

308
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,077
You're our new applicant.

309
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,538
Albert, wasn't it?

310
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,497
Yes.

311
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,667
In that case, sign here.

312
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,888
Albert... Brudzewski?

313
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,264
Yes.

314
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,267
Brudzewo is the name of my hometown.

315
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,853
I use that name for my signature.

316
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,105
I see.

317
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,232
Well, anything will do.

318
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,736
Starting tomorrow,
take whatever classes you like.

319
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,134
What? A letter?

320
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,261
For me?

321
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,805
Yes. It's addressed to Potocki.

322
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,390
Potocki?

323
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,309
I don't know anyone by that name.

324
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,480
Still, this is definitely the address.

325
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,400
Well, that is what it says.

326
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,486
But then... could it be intended

327
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,781
for the previous occupant?

328
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,325
I mean, I've never seen
anything like this.

329
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,411
"Certificate of title."

330
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,997
"In the event that
the following book is published,

331
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,708
you will receive
ten percent of the profits."

332
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,501
It's kind of creepy.

333
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,006
Plus, isn't this a weird name for a book?

334
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,259
<i>"On the Movements of the Earth,"</i> it says.

335
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,307
<i>That must be a mistake.</i>

336
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,475
<i>After all, it's the heavens that move.</i>

337
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,353
It's way too suspicious.

338
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:57,107
They didn't even send
the book in question.

339
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,860
Then again, if it brings me money,
I'm fine with that.

340
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:06,366
On the Movements of the Earth<i>, huh?</i>

341
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,540
Hmm?

342
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,088
<i>In 1468,</i>

343
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,844
<i>Albert Brudzewski enrolled
at the University of Kraków at age 23.</i>

344
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:31,224
<i>He would eventually work there
as a teacher for 20 years.</i>

345
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,188
<i>His lectures focused mainly
on mathematics and natural philosophy.</i>

346
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,023
<i>At one point,</i>

347
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:43,111
<i>he expressed skepticism toward
the traditional geocentric model</i>

348
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,946
<i>but refrained from drawing conclusions.</i>

349
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,617
<i>In 1482,</i>

350
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,204
<i>he wrote a commentary
on the astronomy textbook of the time,</i>

New Theories of the Planets<i>.</i>

352
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,336
<i>It would go on to be widely read
at the university.</i>

353
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,633
<i>In 1491,</i>

354
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,180
<i>one of the students
who learned astronomy from his commentary</i>

355
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,392
