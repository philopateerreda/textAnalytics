00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,091
{\an8}EPISODE SIX
MOVE... THE WORLD

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,676
{\an8}We've never met.

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,261
{\an8}What do you want?

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,973
Uh, my name is Oczy.

5
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,893
There are some documents
I'd like you to look at.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,979
If I could guide you to them...

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,899
You smell of blood.

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,152
You're a mercenary, aren't you?

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,612
Forgive me, but I'm a clergyman.

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,407
Please maintain your distance.

11
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,368
Uh, right. Sorry.

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,286
One more thing.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,289
I'd like to confirm something.

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,790
Will these documents

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,294
dramatically change my life?

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,381
If you can't promise me that,
you're not worth my time.

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,259
In a certain sense,

18
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,803
they may be life-changing.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,476
Since... they could anger the Church.

20
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,771
Oh? This might be interesting after all.

21
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,190
Go ahead.

22
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,735
I'll judge how the Church will react.

23
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,237
So, what is this about?

24
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,073
Well, you see...

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,200
I don't really know.

26
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,744
Huh? You don't know?

27
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,205
Then why show them to me?

28
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,290
That too. I, uh...

29
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know.

30
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,086
I'm simply doing as I was told.

31
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,796
What? Told by whom?

32
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,591
A long time ago,
when you served at the Abbey in town,

33
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,470
do you remember a man
who asked you about heavenly bodies?

34
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,430
God knows.

35
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,351
The Abbey forced us
to converse with townspeople,

36
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,812
but I was always bored to tears.

37
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,979
I don't remember.

38
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,148
I... I see.

39
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,401
I came at his request.

40
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,696
He was a person
who kept records like these.

41
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,997
Observations of Mars, huh?

42
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,584
Interesting. They're fairly thorough.

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,463
I guess even some laypeople...

44
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,506
Huh?

45
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,175
Where is the retrograde motion?

46
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,596
The one that occurs every two years.
It's an important phenomenon.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,265
Oh, about that...

48
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,394
He felt betrayed by the retrograde thing

49
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,688
and gave up on stargazing.

50
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,649
What? He felt betrayed?

51
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,902
He didn't know
that planets move in reverse?

52
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,864
In the first place, the word "planet"

53
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,657
comes from <i>planetes,</i>

54
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,576
the Greek word for "wanderer."

55
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,245
Of course their paths wander.

56
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,707
Someone who knew so little

57
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,168
took these detailed notes?

58
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,253
For what purpose?

59
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,255
I don't know.

60
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,052
Forget it.

61
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,015
I can't spare my time
on something so indefinite.

62
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,349
Go home.

63
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,644
Uh... right.

64
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,898
I got my hopes up for nothing.

65
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,985
<i>Why must I be here</i>

66
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,738
<i>in a place like this?</i>

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,722
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

68
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,457
Badeni, do you remember

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,086
the conditions
for admission to this abbey?

70
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,797
Only those recommended

71
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,425
by three or more
elite universities may enter.

72
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
That's right.

73
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,305
Everyone here has been chosen

74
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,640
to do God's work.

75
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,393
I say this with that in mind.

76
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,479
Your work is overwhelming.

77
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,150
Where others work in teams of ten,

78
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,946
you have solved
all these problems on your own.

79
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,740
Yes, Father Abbot.

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,034
Amazing.

81
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,076
However,

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,704
you must also understand

83
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,997
what this means.

84
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,918
How many times must I say this?

85
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,922
You must not study
more than is expected of you.

86
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,092
You must observe the rules.

87
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,345
Keep in step with the others!

88
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,140
It's futile to cooperate
with people of lesser ability.

89
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,934
Speaking out of turn
is also subject to punishment.

90
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,229
One lashing.

91
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,107
Do it yourself.

92
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,820
Good.

93
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,823
Hey!

94
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,627
I never asked for that much.

95
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,921
May I speak now?

96
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,675
Badeni, how long
do you intend to keep this up?

97
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,136
For as long as punishment

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,181
earns me the freedom to study.

99
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,059
You really are a fool.

100
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,605
It's true that you are
our most learned monk,

101
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,067
but you are utterly lacking in prudence.

102
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,362
We cannot afford to be prudent,
Father Abbot.

103
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,279
What?

104
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,991
With such a soft stance,
you'll be swallowed by the times.

105
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,662
If you rely on prudence alone,
you'll never grasp it.

106
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,372
Grasp it?

107
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,373
Grasp what?

108
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,751
What I've been waiting for.

109
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,962
The moment I become special.

110
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,965
My moment of greatness.

111
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,009
The moment I change history!

112
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,306
With such an arrogant attitude,

113
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,933
you'll never be special.

114
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,936
Save that passion for studying theology.

115
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,816
What possible use could you have
for algebra or geometry?

116
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,235
I will use them to solve

117
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,696
God's greatest riddle.

118
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,408
All answers are in the holy scripture.

119
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,869
Then answer me this.

120
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,871
Why do stars

121
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,790
<i>reverse the path of their orbit?</i>

122
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,669
God created two worlds.

123
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,630
This imperfect land below the moon's plane

124
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,509
is subject to cycles
of creation and destruction,

125
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,470
as well as disorderly movement.

126
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,974
<i>Yet the heavens
above the moon's plane are eternal</i>

127
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,809
<i>with no beginning or end.</i>

128
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,396
<i>They should move forever
in a perfect circle.</i>

129
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,482
<i>That I would understand.</i>

130
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,486
But the reality is different.

131
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,156
<i>Within the heavens God created,</i>

132
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:15,244
<i>circles devolve into peculiar rings
with retrograde movements.</i>

133
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,955
{\an8}Humankind must confront

134
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,541
{\an8}the nature of that riddle.

135
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,418
{\an8}Otherwise,

136
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,505
it means that God's design was flawed.

137
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,383
That cannot be.

138
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,427
And that means

139
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,556
there must be a reason
that humankind has yet to discover!

140
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,518
There is no reason!

141
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,229
It is simply as God ordained.

142
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,106
Humankind will never learn

143
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,401
more about the heavens
than what we know now.

144
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,404
Heaven and Earth are in different classes!

145
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,407
Can a pauper know the mind of a noble?

146
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,078
It would be a freak occurrence at best.

147
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,081
You are capable of such things though.

148
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,165
Huh?

149
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,086
{\an8}By looking
within the secure vault of our library,

150
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,048
<i>where you keep the forbidden writings
of heretics and infidels.</i>

151
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,595
Don't speak about that.

152
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,056
I am worthy of knowing!

153
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,600
God has given me this talent.

154
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,104
{\an8}Why must it be restricted by mere humans?

155
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,856
{\an8}Because curiosity is a sin!

156
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,485
{\an8}There are many passages
in the holy scripture which tell us that.

157
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,863
Your lust for knowledge is too strong!

158
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,827
Do not think of reading
the forbidden writings, even by mistake.

159
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,829
You won't get off with just a lashing.

160
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,664
What will you do?

161
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,625
I will burn your eyes.

162
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,462
Furthermore, for the time being,

163
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,090
you are forbidden
from theoretical research.

164
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,008
What?

165
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,303
You are still lacking.

166
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,222
Not in knowledge, but in maturity.

167
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,016
That's an unreasonable punishment!

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,727
May God bless you.

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
Damn it.

170
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,030
Anyone could do this.

171
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,616
Why must it be me?

172
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,536
<i>I've acquired all there is to gain here.</i>

173
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,164
<i>Should I give up the cloth
and go to university?</i>

174
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,168
<i>How careless of him.</i>

175
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,088
<i>And the Abbot calls me imprudent?</i>

176
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,009
What's that book cover?

177
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,770
This inscription on the edge...

178
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,105
I knew it! Forbidden writings!

179
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,441
And they're about the cosmos.

180
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,529
Did our conversation spur his curiosity?

181
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,657
You're just as lustful

182
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,617
for knowledge as me.

183
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,843
What are you doing in my room?

184
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,430
You! Don't tell me that's--

185
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,723
Wait.

186
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,477
I haven't witnessed you read it yet.

187
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,479
{\an8}You still have a choice.

188
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,940
Put the book down and leave!

189
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,695
I will not have our abbey

190
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,196
produce a blinded monk!

191
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,491
Especially not under my watch.

192
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,620
If you open that book,
you will be pinned down in an instant.

193
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,372
There will be no time to read.

194
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,457
It's futile!

195
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,211
You're right.

196
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,463
I can only open it for an instant.

197
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,716
Even so,

198
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,718
I've been waiting for this.

199
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,972
Waiting for such a special instant!

200
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,641
How unfortunate.

201
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,226
<i>"Measurements indicate</i>

202
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,730
<i>that the Sun must be 109 times
larger than Earth. As such--"</i>

203
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,526
No!

204
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,780
Actions like this will destroy
the one true church!

205
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,866
{\an8}The Pope will be secularized

206
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,118
{\an8}while the abbeys succumb to dogma!

207
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,121
The Church is getting rich
selling indulgences!

208
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,583
{\an8}How can you offer hope
to the lost souls like this?

209
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,252
{\an8}At this rate, opposing sects

210
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,005
{\an8}will bring the Church crashing down!

211
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,423
If that happens,

212
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,385
you'll take me down with you!

213
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,639
You are hereby demoted.

214
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,559
You'll spend the rest of your life

215
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,269
somewhere far from academia.

216
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,813
Don't think about secular life either.

217
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,648
The Abbey has the power

218
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,401
to forbid any university
from accepting you.

219
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,988
But before that, I'll burn those eyes.

220
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,492
If you're lucky, you won't go blind.

221
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,495
I hope at least one of them survives.

222
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,915
Now then. May God bless you.

223
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,046
Wait!

224
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,468
I'll have a look.

225
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,180
However, I'll need you
to continue those observations.

226
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,057
That's my condition.

227
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,351
M-Me?

228
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,603
Start by observing Mars tonight.

229
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,439
I happen to need it for my own research.

230
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,358
The method of observation

231
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,652
should be described in that diary.

232
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,492
I'm agreeing to help
a suspicious peasant like you.

233
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,036
This is the least you can do.

234
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,081
B-But I...

235
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,920
I can't look at the sky.

236
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,090
Forgive me,

237
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,176
<i>but I have no time for jokes.</i>

238
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,511
<i>Farewell.</i>

239
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,946
It's no use. I can't do it.

240
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,366
Why do I have to do it in the first place?

241
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,205
No, there's no reason I should have to.

242
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,916
That's right.

243
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,877
<i>I should discard these</i>

244
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,920
<i>and start a new life in town.</i>

245
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,298
<i>I can't go back to where I was,</i>

246
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,176
<i>but I can wander until I find
a new place to start over.</i>

247
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,137
<i>I'll be reduced to bottom rank,</i>

248
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
<i>but that's no different from now.</i>

249
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,017
<i>After all, suffering
is unavoidable in this world.</i>

250
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,227
<i>If I can endure this, then when I die,</i>

251
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,604
<i>heaven will be waiting!</i>

252
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>That's right. Heaven!</i>

253
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,738
Huh?

254
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,873
<i>On the other hand,</i>

255
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,500
<i>those two were the only people I ever met</i>

256
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,503
{\an8}<i>who valued this world more than heaven.</i>

257
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,090
<i>Surely they went to hell.</i>

258
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,384
<i>I can't listen to people like them.</i>

259
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,012
<i>But then,</i>

260
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,890
<i>for as long as I've lived,</i>

261
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,894
<i>those two were the only ones...</i>

262
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>At the moment of death,</i>

263
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,316
{\an8}no one seemed as satisfied as them.

264
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,403
Why?

265
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,323
They knew they were going to hell.

266
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,958
{\an8}No! Even if I look, it changes nothing.

267
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,292
{\an8}Don't expect anything!

268
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,463
<i>Despair can be turned into hope.</i>

269
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,466
<i>Place your hope in this world!</i>

270
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:17,935
{\an8}I can't.

271
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:19,895
{\an8}But...

272
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,906
Yes... Not bad for your first time.

273
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,075
Now then.

274
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,995
Show me the way to the documents.

275
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,048
Is it something
that will change your life?

276
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,175
No, that's not it.

277
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,136
This

278
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,556
will change the universe.

279
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,018
<i>Orb.</i>

280
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,937
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

281
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,106
Huh?

282
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,941
It will change

283
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,568
the universe?

284
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,570
What?!

285
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,321
{\an8}A-Are you okay?!

286
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,869
I'm fine.

287
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,247
I merely vomited

288
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,167
years of pitiful common sense
and preconceptions.

289
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,670
This is amazing.

290
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,049
I knew God made no mistakes.

291
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,508
Even more incredible,

292
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,178
our Lord made a cosmos
that humans can understand.

293
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,806
The Church could definitely be a problem,

294
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,809
but if I find the right interpretation,

295
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
publishing isn't out of the question.

296
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,191
What in the world does it say?

297
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,151
Well,

298
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,195
I'll summarize.

299
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,405
It revises and fills the gap between

300
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,951
Aristotle's concentric sphere theory
and Ptolemy's eccentric circles.

301
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,996
In addition, it disputes
the lack of equilibrium

302
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,332
between the cosmos
and its individual points,

303
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,711
as well as the divergent calculations
currently central to all theories.

304
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,840
All those issues can be traced
to the substantial number

305
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,343
of unpredictable movements
among the heavenly bodies.

306
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,013
However, it explains those problems
with a simple theory of motion.

307
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,931
Huh?

308
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,350
Well, to summarize even further...

309
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,436
The Earth is moving.

310
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,735
It's not moving at all.

311
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,778
Right?

312
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,280
But for a mere mistake,

313
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,533
the ideas written here

314
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,784
are far too rational.

315
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,246
Let's try an experiment.

316
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,957
Use that diary to draw

317
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,626
the orbit of Mars over the past two years.

318
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,589
Um...

319
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,679
EARTH, SUN, MARS

320
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,514
Like this?

321
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,683
Yeah. That'll do.

322
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,395
This is the greatest riddle
of the heavens.

323
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,897
Retrograde planetary motion.

324
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,443
<i>Humankind has given up
on finding an explanation for this</i>

325
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,697
<i>and has focused instead
on calculation methods.</i>

326
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,992
<i>As a result,
theories have grown more complex,</i>

327
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,327
<i>employing more and more postulates.</i>

328
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,914
It's all because the planets
don't stick to forward motion.

329
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,334
But in fact, that was wrong.

330
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:34,798
The planets were moving forward,
even while they moved backward.

331
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,135
Huh? Isn't that impossible?

332
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,389
Yes, it is.

333
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,393
That is, if the Earth is still.

334
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
But if the Earth moves,

335
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,026
it's possible.

336
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,536
What are you doing?

337
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,539
I'm mimicking the cosmos.

338
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,131
Walk around this branch,

339
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,676
along the circle closer
to the center, and pass me.

340
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,594
Huh?

341
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,637
Now!

342
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,067
Did something happen?

343
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,318
Yeah.

344
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,654
In that brief instant,

345
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:43,075
I found the secret to overturning
1,000 years of Ptolemaic theory.

346
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,119
Don't you get it?

347
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,871
As I was Mars,

348
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,706
and you were the Earth,

349
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,875
what did your eyes see?

350
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,002
Huh?

351
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,922
<i>In the beginning,</i>

352
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,007
<i>while I was in front of you,</i>

353
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,510
<i>I appeared to be
moving forward as I circled.</i>

354
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,638
<i>But our difference in speed
closed the gap.</i>

355
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:09,851
<i>From your perspective,
my velocity seemed to slow</i>

356
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,273
<i>until we were side by side,
and then you passed me.</i>

357
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,567
<i>From your perspective as the Earth,</i>

358
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,861
<i>Mars appeared to move backward.</i>

359
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,699
<i>But once you completely passed me,</i>

360
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,867
<i>Mars seemed to move forward once again.</i>

361
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,038
If there really is no retrograde motion,

362
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,624
and it only appears that way

363
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,294
because we see things
from Earth as bystanders,

364
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
planetary motion would look like this.

365
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,925
You can tell which is simpler, right?

366
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,552
Yes.

367
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,306
Do you understand what this means?

368
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,767
That stone chest
is calling out to humanity.

369
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,396
The heavens are sublime, solemn,

370
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,481
sacred, and sweeping.

371
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:01,737
But they are also
in harmony with the Earth.

372
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,743
The heavens and Earth in harmony?

373
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:13,165
Are you saying the heavens
are as corrupt as our world?

374
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,167
{\an8}Or perhaps,

375
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,586
the world we live in

376
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,297
is not the ugly bottom of the universe.

377
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,216
Instead,

378
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,762
it has always been part
of that beauty up there.

379
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,224
In my case, that's what I believe.

380
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,354
B-But that's...

381
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,815
Heaven and Earth

382
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,734
are one?

383
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,527
{\an8}Could it be?

384
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,827
Tonight's sky somehow...

385
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,413
Do you feel God's grace?

386
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,582
After all, this sky

387
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,293
is offering me a great reward.

388
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,464
Um, that may be...

389
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,884
But in a simpler way...

390
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,511
Huh?

391
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,346
Something about it

392
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,848
seems more beautiful than ever.

393
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,480
There's only one way

394
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,359
to make that "something" absolute.

395
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,738
Move... the world.

396
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,999
