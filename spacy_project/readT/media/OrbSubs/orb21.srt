1
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,015
What's the commotion?

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,517
Who are you people?

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,060
Where are you headed?

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,484
We're tinsmiths.

5
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,905
{\an8}We're escorting our young one

6
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,658
{\an8}and this female worker
as they begin their pilgrimage.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,536
Here's our authorization.

8
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,628
Why are you armed?

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,922
In case of bandits.

10
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,425
I've heard they're dangerous.

11
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,260
Yeah?

12
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,513
Well, I guess it's fine.

13
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,767
Thank you.

14
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,729
If you don't mind, we're in a hurry.

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,189
Wait, please!

16
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,277
Do you have any cloth to spare?

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,404
I need some to wrap a torch.

18
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,032
Then you may have my mantle.

19
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,035
No, I couldn't waste something that fine!

20
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,540
Isn't there anything lying around inside?

21
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,168
- Excuse me!
- Huh?

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,545
You can have this.

23
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,839
Huh? But...

24
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,050
As you can see, it's quite old.

25
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,344
{\an8}I was thinking of throwing it away.

26
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,890
In that case, I accept.

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,725
Forgive the intrusion!

28
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,435
May God bless you.

29
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,574
You saved us back there.

30
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,326
I'm grateful.

31
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,079
It's fine. Forget it.

32
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,666
I'll lose out too if things end here.

33
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,338
Convictions come with a price, right?

34
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,715
Yes.

35
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,930
Conviction can become a curse.

36
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,432
Keep wandering.

37
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,526
Plus...

38
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,112
{\an8}If we fail now,

39
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,240
{\an8}Jolenta's inspiration will die too.

40
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,325
Inspiration?

41
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,410
Yes.

42
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,664
You all would probably toss it aside
as unnecessary sympathy.

43
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,001
In that case, I'll preserve it.

44
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,297
As I listen to your plans,

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,507
the future I imagine you'll reach

46
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,761
may contain Jolenta's goals
but not her memories.

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,515
Not her guilt, her regrets,

48
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,018
or her doubts.

49
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,357
If you all have inherited her plans,

50
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,111
then I will inherit her heart.

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,782
Why?

52
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,704
When did you develop
such an affinity for our leader?

53
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,874
I don't know.

54
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,378
But maybe it's because
someone I met has died.

55
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,426
Oh, and... I promised
to send a letter for her.

56
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,278
Oh! We've been waiting for you, Schmidt.

57
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,615
You took so long,
we thought you must be dead.

58
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,534
It seems my time hasn't come yet,

59
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,036
Bolko.

60
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,830
Who's the girl?

61
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,207
A lost child?

62
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,876
Oh, uh, I'm...

63
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,878
She's a collaborator.

64
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,882
I'm Draka. Pleased to meet you.

65
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,802
She burned the book.

66
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,472
Which means she's now the only one
who knows its contents.

67
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,140
What?

68
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,436
And in return for her telling us,

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,897
we promised to loan her
the printing press.

70
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,148
What?

71
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,608
Furthermore,

72
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,236
she recently saved us from danger.

73
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,281
That's all there is to know.

74
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,660
{\an8}Can we trust her?

75
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,122
At the moment, we have no choice.

76
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,590
Well then, have a look at our treasure.

77
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,342
This is...

78
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,014
Yes, it may not look like much,
but don't be fooled.

79
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,224
It's a printing press.

80
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,186
What about the leader?

81
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,357
She's dead.

82
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,244
- Is that so?
- Yes.

83
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,040
It was all for the sake of this mission.

84
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,672
Do you remember

85
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,258
our organization's philosophy?

86
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,887
We're going to make this world
a more open place.

87
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,602
We'll confront the existing order

88
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,605
and expand new horizons
for future generations.

89
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,776
And how do we do that?

90
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,571
Even the most eloquent voice will fade

91
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,073
if it ceases to speak.

92
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,700
Even the firmest pillar

93
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,202
will decay with time.

94
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,371
Everyone dies.

95
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,539
Everything is in flux.

96
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,794
Even so, we know the way.

97
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,506
The way to strengthen our convictions,
visualize our thoughts,

98
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,050
and turn seconds into eternity.

99
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,387
We will carry this moment far away

100
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,305
to some distant future

101
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,225
or to the hands of another.

102
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,144
We know how it can be done.

103
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,357
<i>Our method is impactful.</i>

104
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,695
<i>We have the power to dissolve
the existing order and social classes.</i>

105
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,076
We will make it happen.

106
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,748
Let us now begin our publishing operation!

107
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,732
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

108
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,720
{\an8}EPISODE 21
THE TIMES ARE CHANGING

109
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,638
{\an8}Frei...

110
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,060
These are the manuscript and type.

111
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,898
Good. In that case,
I will build the letterpress.

112
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,862
So, what book title will grace
our first-ever page?

113
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,492
{\an8}"On the Movements of the Earth."

114
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,703
Right. For that--

115
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,704
Wait a second.

116
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,958
No one knows

117
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,754
that Jolenta is the name
of the Liberation Front's leader, right?

118
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,297
No.

119
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,840
Then it should be safe.

120
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,137
Why don't we put her name
on the cover as publisher?

121
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,766
Yes, that sounds good.

122
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,142
You got it.

123
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,275
This is bad.
Some of the letters have cracked.

124
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,864
It must have been then.

125
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,661
Well, type does break easily.

126
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,830
Damn it!

127
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,416
All the "N"s are cracked.

128
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,585
We have no choice.

129
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,336
We'll have to halt operations for now.

130
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,089
We'll acquire lead in town.

131
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,048
Right.

132
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,353
What about these?

133
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,354
- Huh?
- Huh?

134
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,815
They're made of lead.

135
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,191
What if you melt them?

136
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,696
This should be enough to help, right?

137
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,906
Yes, but...

138
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,241
It's fine.

139
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,910
{\an8}I'd rather see the printing start.

140
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,125
We owe you one, girl.

141
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,502
Then let's begin.

142
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,705
So this is... movable type.

143
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,291
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH
PUBLISHED BY JOLENTA

144
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,252
Okay! Bring paper!

145
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,338
We'll print as much as we can!

146
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,966
You three find out
if there's any way to get lead in town.

147
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,094
But don't raise suspicion.

148
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,014
Everyone else, help set the type.

149
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,432
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

150
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,269
Everyone... get to work.

151
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,106
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

152
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,023
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

153
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,582
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

154
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,085
Things are going well.

155
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,630
We should be able to transport them
in a few days, right?

156
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,008
Yes, the technology is impressive.

157
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,593
Once it starts, it's fast.

158
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,012
If this succeeds,

159
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,432
we'll have more options in the future.

160
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,602
The future?

161
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,441
It's my turn to guard the horses.

162
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,900
Right.

163
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,157
<i>This is the final stage.</i>

164
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,660
<i>We're one step closer
to our ultimate goal.</i>

165
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,996
<i>It's all according to plan.</i>

166
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,081
<i>No problems at all.</i>

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,668
As I listen to your plans,

168
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,879
the future I imagine you'll reach

169
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,467
may contain Jolenta's goals
but not her memories.

170
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,846
I'll inherit her heart.

171
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,228
<i>No. Everything is as God intended.</i>

172
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,690
<i>Feelings are of no concern.</i>

173
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,779
<i>If I waver now,</i>

174
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,656
<i>I won't be able to achieve my own goals.</i>

175
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,749
<i>That's right. The plan has succeeded.</i>

176
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,171
Captain.

177
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,172
Huh?

178
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,636
I know I'm repeating myself,

179
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,305
but allow me to ask one more time.

180
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,433
This mission

181
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:34,271
could be called
our most important task, correct?

182
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,773
Yes.

183
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,566
This location

184
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,986
was worth trading
the leader's life to keep secret?

185
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,655
Yes.

186
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,449
If we were to be found here,

187
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,909
it would be a disaster?

188
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,037
Yes.

189
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,041
{\an8}And finally, the horses we had here

190
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,294
{\an8}were our only means of transport, correct?

191
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,258
Yes.

192
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,510
Good.

193
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,013
Then my work here is done.

194
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,558
Did you report us?

195
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,809
Yes.

196
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,019
While I was in town.

197
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,556
Strike the final blow.

198
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,393
The knights will be here soon.

199
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,730
You won't even have time
to take the printing press!

200
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,525
{\an8}My victory is secure.

201
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,695
Why did you betray us?

202
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,447
On whose orders?

203
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,198
Whom do you serve?

204
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,493
No one.

205
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,830
God and justice, perhaps.

206
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,170
All this time, I've hated you people.

207
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,341
{\an8}I've hated you heretic filth!

208
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,427
{\an8}You've killed

209
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,804
{\an8}just as many knights as I have.

210
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,972
{\an8}You're guilty too.

211
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,477
It was a necessary sacrifice
to pursue my convictions.

212
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,979
I will extinguish you all.

213
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,150
That's been my conviction
since the day I was born!

214
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,735
I have no doubts!

215
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,741
You're awfully sloppy
for someone pursuing their convictions.

216
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,828
Isn't it too early to confess?

217
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,498
As long as the knights haven't arrived,

218
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,084
we can still escape.

219
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,461
You can't be sure we'll be killed.

220
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,383
{\an8}You don't get it.

221
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,510
{\an8}This is an act of mercy.

222
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,512
{\an8}- Mercy?
- Yes.

223
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,555
{\an8}I'm giving you time.

224
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,351
{\an8}Time to understand your own shallowness.

225
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,020
{\an8}Time to experience despair.

226
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,941
And finally, time to repent.

227
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,862
It's not too late for salvation.

228
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,741
As a true believer,
I'll hear your confession.

229
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,036
So say it!

230
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:41,291
Say that the Church orthodoxy
you've mocked was right all along!

231
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,043
Say it to me!

232
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,378
Now!

233
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,685
You can't see it, can you?

234
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,733
This righteous... cross...

235
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,992
Captain!

236
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,411
Several suspicious carriages
are heading this--

237
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,246
Huh?

238
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,834
{\an8}Frei has betrayed us.

239
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,252
What?!

240
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,010
And that's the situation.

241
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,976
I hid the molds and the manuscript.

242
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,979
But what do we do with the printing press?

243
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,899
We have no time to think.

244
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,568
Our enemies are closing in,

245
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,695
and we have no horses.

246
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,073
But that's...

247
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,201
Are you suggesting
we abandon the printing press?!

248
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,245
That's the least of our problems.

249
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,039
This place has broad visibility.

250
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,542
<i>They'll spot us wherever we run.</i>

251
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,294
<i>Worst case scenario... we'll all die.</i>

252
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,507
That's correct.

253
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,302
But there's nothing else we can do.

254
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,471
We should all run in separate directions.

255
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,767
Those who are lucky enough
to escape will start over.

256
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:09,022
Realistically,
that's our only way to survive.

257
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,859
It's our one and only option.

258
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,451
No.

259
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,954
There are two.

260
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,124
If publishing is the goal,

261
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,209
there's one other option.

262
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,920
What's that?

263
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,092
You can all work together

264
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,303
to ensure that I escape.

265
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,808
{\an8}What do you mean?

266
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,520
{\an8}I'll explain my plan.

267
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,692
A-Are you out of your mind?!

268
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,360
That will never work!

269
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,363
Do you realize who we're about to fight?!

270
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,865
It's the Church itself!

271
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,450
I know that.

272
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,245
But... rather than the Church,

273
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,289
I'll talk to him personally.

274
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,125
If we steal a horse,
I can get there in a few hours!

275
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,126
It's impossible!

276
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,337
Nothing is impossible!

277
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,590
Especially when it comes
to people's hearts!

278
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,345
I don't believe in God.

279
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,723
You all may reject my stance,

280
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,684
but it enables me to see things you can't.

281
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,189
The times are changing.

282
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,816
No, they have to change.

283
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,027
And I can take advantage of it.

284
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,363
I can convince him!

285
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,824
I assume you understand

286
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,327
what you're asking of us.

287
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,248
It's true that if we work together,

288
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,751
we can ensure that one or two escape.

289
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,754
But in return,

290
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,090
the rest of us will die.

291
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,926
Yes. Of course.

292
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,011
But the book will be published.

293
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,681
Isn't that this organization's goal?

294
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,809
That's why there are two options.

295
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,937
A chance few can escape

296
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,772
or one of your choosing.

297
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,652
I disagree.

298
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,154
Even if we helped you escape,

299
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,241
I doubt you'll convince anyone.

300
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,078
The chances of success are too slim.

301
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,333
That said, even if a few of us
besides you were to get away,

302
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,086
the chances of obtaining
another printing press,

303
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:40,382
on top of achieving
publication and distribution,

304
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,342
are still very low.

305
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,472
What'll it be, Captain?

306
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,940
I know a good way
to break deadlocks like this.

307
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,197
We'll ask God.

308
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,869
Heads, everyone runs.

309
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,080
Tails, you help me escape.

310
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,126
Here we go.

311
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,587
Wait.

312
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,464
{\an8}Are you sure

313
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,216
{\an8}you're okay with this?

314
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,137
{\an8}Yes.

315
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,695
It's heads.

316
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,284
Everyone runs.

317
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,169
Okay! Hurry up, everybody.

318
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,016
You run.

319
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,018
We'll protect you.

320
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,524
Hear that, everyone?

321
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,403
Captain, is that a suggestion?

322
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,905
{\an8}It's an order.

323
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,908
Understood.

324
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,957
