1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,386
It seems these eyes
have failed me at last.

2
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:16,641
But there's still something
I must see before I die.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,272
Your recent treatise impressed me.

4
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,191
Professor! I'm honored.

5
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,363
It's been 20 years
since your arrival here.

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,782
Perhaps it's time.

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,456
I shall hand over my universe to you.

8
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,089
This is...

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,761
This is my archival vault.

10
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,888
Only I can enter.

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,724
It's incredible.

12
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,476
Take a look at this.

13
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:08,193
This is the model of the universe
that I have devised and refined.

14
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,446
Double epicycles. Amazing.

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,700
The accuracy is faultless,
and the circular motions are uniform too.

16
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,202
Yes.

17
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,871
In all of human history,

18
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,459
no one but me has achieved
this level of precision.

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,338
This is the universe in its proper form.

20
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,387
I have sacrificed all other possibilities,
options, and opportunities,

21
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,725
and devoted my entire life
to refining this model.

22
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,353
{\an8}I never needed collaborators.

23
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,941
{\an8}I was certain that God would choose
only one person to reach the truth,

24
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,237
{\an8}and I swore I wouldn't tell anyone
until it was completed.

25
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,156
Then why tell me?

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,367
Because that one person

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,161
may be you, not me.

28
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,332
When you do research as long as I have,

29
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,917
many things become clear.

30
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,380
In terms of observations, theories,
calculations, and imagination,

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,259
you are now superior to me in every way.

32
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,512
The road to truth is perilously narrow.

33
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,266
But you may be capable
of reaching the end.

34
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,977
I could never...

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,481
Perfecting the cosmos is beyond me.

36
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,569
I won't ask you to start right away.

37
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,655
If you're ever interested, just tell me.

38
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,417
<i>Two epicycles...</i>

39
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,461
<i>The universe in its proper form?</i>

40
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,507
<i>Can I really... inherit such a task?</i>

41
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,051
<i>What am I afraid of?</i>

42
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,888
<i>Isn't audacity important?</i>

43
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,183
<i>That's right! I have to be courageous!</i>

44
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,893
<i>I will perfect the Professor's--</i>

45
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,064
<i>What... was that?</i>

46
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,320
My eyes are playing tricks on me.

47
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,238
I must be exhausted.

48
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,578
Don't worry.
It wasn't really the final phase.

49
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,541
Professor, do you have a moment?

50
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,294
It's about the completion of your model.

51
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,172
Oh, have you given it some thought?

52
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,926
Yes. Your ideas are brilliant.

53
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,012
More than that, they will change history.

54
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,680
However,

55
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,808
I don't think I'm up to the task.

56
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,187
I cannot carry the burden
of completing the cosmos.

57
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,151
Is that so?

58
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,198
Find me if you change your mind.

59
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,702
But it'll be too late
when I'm on the verge of finishing!

60
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,418
Professor.

61
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,797
I know my own body.

62
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,966
I don't have long.

63
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,427
I've known it all this time,

64
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:27,100
but I've never had the courage to ask you.

65
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,143
Five years ago,

66
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,896
when you turned me down,

67
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,984
was it because you doubted my theory?

68
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,987
Absolutely not!
Your theory is magnificent!

69
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,031
I've never seen such an accurate model!

70
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,867
Indeed.

71
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,703
It is beautiful.

72
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,872
It's precise, sublime,

73
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,459
and in accordance
with Aristotle and the Holy Scripture.

74
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,714
I've never once doubted that.

75
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,592
But...

76
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,887
It's never complete!

77
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,348
No matter how much work I put into it!

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,519
With my abilities,

79
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,814
there will always be errors
that can't be overlooked.

80
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:20,111
Even after a lifetime of work,
I could never reach my goal.

81
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,072
No, I wish it was only that.

82
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,616
What terrifies me the most

83
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,036
is that my hypothesis

84
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,622
may be completely wrong,
right down to its basic assumptions.

85
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,834
If that's the case,

86
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,796
what a waste I've made of my life!

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,048
No.

88
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,050
That can't be it.

89
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,594
You couldn't complete your model

90
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,513
simply because you lacked
the ability to do so.

91
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,767
But that doesn't mean
your research was wrong!

92
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,062
The life you dedicated to it
was not a mistake!

93
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,025
One day...

94
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,488
One day, tell me when we meet in heaven.

95
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,908
<i>The truth.</i>

96
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,052
Um, is the Professor--

97
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,095
He's gone.

98
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,389
I leave the rest to you.

99
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,182
I'll be in the laboratory.

100
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,184
Huh?

101
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,811
Doing what?

102
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,773
<i>Perfecting the cosmos.</i>

103
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,716
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

104
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,118
{\an8}Since we last met,
I have been generous enough

105
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,330
{\an8}to consider your ridiculous theory.

106
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,876
And I've decided
to let you view my records.

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,878
Really?

108
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,130
However, I have one condition.

109
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,219
{\an8}You must prove true
what I know to be false.

110
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,763
What exactly do you mean?

111
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,473
Long ago,

112
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,558
I saw something.

113
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,019
No, I mistakenly saw something.

114
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
Of course, such an error

115
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,358
no longer concerns me now.

116
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,487
<i>But it's true
that this one-time mistaken sighting</i>

117
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,866
<i>planted the seeds of doubt
in my life's work.</i>

118
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,370
That's why I want to take this opportunity

119
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,414
to make certain that I was wrong.

120
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,500
What are you talking about?

121
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,585
What is it that you saw?

122
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,006
Venus in its final phase.

123
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,676
What?

124
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,302
B-But that's--

125
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,556
Venus in its final phase?
What does that mean?

126
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,809
Earth is the center
of the geocentric model,

127
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,603
so of course Venus
revolves around Earth too.

128
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,521
EARTH, VENUS, SUN

129
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,897
<i>That means Venus</i>

130
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,359
<i>can only be illuminated by the Sun
from certain directions,</i>

131
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,070
<i>and its shape always appears incomplete.</i>

132
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,948
To see Venus in its final phase,

133
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,786
<i>it would have to be illuminated
after circling behind the Sun.</i>

134
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,871
<i>If that's the case,</i>

135
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,875
<i>it would be more natural to think
the planets revolve around the Sun.</i>

136
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,502
<i>And that would mean</i>

137
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,464
the current model which places
the Earth at the center

138
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,757
would be ruled out.

139
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,218
Correct.

140
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,178
But the opposite is also true.

141
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,724
If you can't observe Venus
approaching fullness,

142
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,018
heliocentrism would be ruled out.

143
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,646
If you imbeciles are correct
in your hypothesis,

144
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,526
then today, when Venus is small
and far away, it should appear full.

145
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,323
{\an8}Tonight, we will settle
the matter once and for all.

146
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,993
<i>But first, I will test your eyesight.</i>

147
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,166
I've drawn a shape as small
as a human pupil on that board.

148
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,628
You must tell me
if it is a square or a circle.

149
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,257
Do that, and I'll accept that your vision
is as good as mine was back then.

150
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,927
I could never see something
that small from so far away.

151
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,013
It's audacious to even try.

152
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,809
Now, can you see
if it's a square or a circle?

153
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,687
- No.
- Huh?

154
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,939
{\an8}It's neither.

155
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,194
The shape is a half-circle
with the right side missing.

156
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,949
Well... I guess you'll do.

157
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,203
I'm going back to my room.

158
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,246
Call me when Venus appears.

159
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,050
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

160
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,927
If...

161
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,097
If I don't see Venus in its final phase,

162
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,183
that means Earth
is the center of the universe

163
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,354
and the bottom of everything, right?

164
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,815
I'm worried.

165
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,025
Somehow, I still feel

166
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,028
like that is probably true.

167
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,823
Is that because
the world you've experienced

168
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,534
is full of suffering?

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,286
Yes.

170
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,288
I know how you feel.

171
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,418
I've never thought
there was salvation on Earth either.

172
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:55,131
We've been taught that our duty
is to ascend from this corrupt realm

173
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,050
and make it to heaven.

174
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,929
Even so, it has always bothered me.

175
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,556
Our world

176
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,225
holds too much beauty
for such a lowly place.

177
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,728
Ferocious nature,

178
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,354
primitive animals,

179
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,689
and sinful humans...

180
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,025
Even the fruits of tragedy like those

181
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,570
are all beautiful in their own way.

182
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,072
There must be a reason for that.

183
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,493
And it may be that the Earth moves.

184
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,163
If the Earth and the sky are one,

185
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,876
then no matter how corrupt our world is,
it will never be without light.

186
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,920
It's time.

187
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,174
Venus will only be visible
for three hours.

188
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,343
- Badeni.
- Huh?

189
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,429
I have a question.

190
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,098
Even if I say Venus appears full,

191
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,727
couldn't Count Piast refuse to believe it?

192
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,228
Yes.

193
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,063
But even if that happens,

194
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,065
at least I will know the truth.

195
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,319
Are you worried?

196
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,071
Yes, of course.

197
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,533
No matter what the result is,

198
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,204
what I see today will shape the universe.

199
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,414
How could I not feel burdened?

200
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,835
To be honest, I don't understand much

201
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,588
about the things you two say or do.

202
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,925
It's even less clear
how this affects my faith.

203
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,845
Or rather, I was merely
caught up in all of this.

204
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,556
I never had any desire
to change the world.

205
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,643
I only wanted to go to heaven.

206
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:35,564
I have no idea why I'm here
or doing any of this.

207
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,150
{\an8}These past few days

208
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,362
{\an8}have been the most puzzling of my life.

209
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,741
Despite all of that,
what I find hardest to understand...

210
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,164
is the fact that right now,
I want to see Venus in its final phase.

211
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,585
In that case,

212
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,713
there is nothing more we can do for you.

213
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,631
No.

214
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,634
But if you don't mind,

215
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>please hope.</i>

216
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,409
<i>See it.</i>

217
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,745
<i>Look full.</i>

218
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,248
<i>I must see it.</i>

219
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,959
<i>It must look full.</i>

220
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,545
<i>See it!</i>

221
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,969
EARTH

222
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,976
It looks full.

223
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,776
How mysterious.

224
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,238
It's the same sky I've always seen,

225
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,533
but now it looks so different.

226
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,036
- I'll bet.
- Huh?

227
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,582
This is what it means...
to learn something, I think.

228
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,047
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

229
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,048
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

230
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,802
And so, Count Piast,

231
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,220
since Venus appears full--

232
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,514
Are you okay?

233
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,269
I won't accept it.

234
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,395
It can't be.

235
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,689
It's a lie you've concocted.

236
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,650
You're trying to trick me.

237
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,943
We wouldn't!

238
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,070
{\an8}No, when I think clearly,

239
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,699
{\an8}even if Venus really appears full,

240
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,328
that is only proof
that Venus revolves around the Sun.

241
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,748
It's not proof that the Earth moves.

242
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,334
My model is still correct!

243
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,586
Yes. You're right.

244
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,838
You could think of it that way.

245
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,343
But is the universe
born from such thinking

246
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,387
the natural product of God

247
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,639
or the product of human stubbornness?

248
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,392
How would it look to you?

249
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,607
{\an8}Young imbeciles like yourselves
could never understand!

250
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,361
My history, the history of humankind,

251
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:33,117
and years of accumulated learning
should never be so easily denied!

252
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,952
Then what if

253
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:39,373
there was something powerful enough
to instantly deny such learning?

254
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,626
Something greater
than individual needs or will.

255
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,338
Something that acts mercilessly
and without prejudice.

256
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,882
If such a thing existed,

257
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,176
what do you think it would be called?

258
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,599
{\an8}I would call it...

259
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,144
<i>One day...</i>

260
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,023
<i>One day, tell me when we meet in heaven.</i>

261
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,609
I would call it

262
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,945
truth.

263
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,332
Here is the key to the archival vault.

264
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,209
Everything is stored in there.

265
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,088
Thank you very much.

266
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,965
We accept it.

267
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,307
Excuse me...

268
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,857
How many...

269
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,318
Just how many years of life

270
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,114
do you think this key represents?

271
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,079
{\an8}Two thousand years.

272
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:07,544
{\an8}If all those years
did not lead to an answer,

273
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,174
{\an8}perhaps the truth never needed us at all.

274
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,552
However, even if we were wrong,

275
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:20,766
what we have written
will have meaning to history.

276
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,144
I pray for that to be true.

277
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,199
How was it?

278
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,118
Incredible.

279
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,079
I can fully concentrate
on research with these.

280
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,831
For now,

281
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,750
please carry the documents
we need to the village, Oczy.

282
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,668
What?

283
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,839
We can't work here
if we don't belong to this organization.

284
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh, right.

285
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,592
As for you, Jolenta...

286
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,886
I'll leave the choice to you,

287
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,974
but I'd prefer it
if your involvement ended here.

288
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,684
I'd like to work alone.

289
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,061
Very well.

290
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,941
Besides, I don't think
I have much else to offer at this point.

291
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,778
Still, you've already been a great help.

292
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,365
I rarely say anything like this,

293
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,034
but I'd like to repay you if I can.

294
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,747
In that case, please perfect
the heliocentric model.

295
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,001
Yes. I promise.

296
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,836
One more thing.

297
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,714
If we happen to be arrested in the future,

298
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,299
pretend you know nothing.

299
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,261
That will be best for you
and for heliocentrism.

300
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,306
I'll be going then.

301
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,808
Oczy, please handle the records.

302
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,227
Uh, right.

303
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,442
Well... Thank you very much.

304
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,818
I'll be going too.

305
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,240
Excuse me!

306
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,828
- Can I ask you one thing?
- Yes?

307
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,498
What does it feel like

308
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,334
to be able to read?

309
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,922
Oh, uh, I know it's obvious to all of you,

310
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,425
but until recently, the only person
I knew who could read

311
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,887
was my mentor in the guild.

312
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,516
Do you promise not to tell anyone
what I am about to say?

313
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,645
Huh? Uh, yes.

314
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,314
As a disciple of the Church,

315
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,776
I know I shouldn't
use these words lightly.

316
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,364
But I can't think
of any other way to express it.

317
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,618
Reading and writing... are like miracles.

318
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,166
Of course, I don't mean they're the same
as the miracles performed by our savior!

319
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,045
Still, reading and writing are amazing.

320
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,674
Using letters, a person
can cross space and time.

321
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,719
I might shed tears
reading the news of 200 years ago

322
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,681
or laugh at rumors from 1,000 years ago.

323
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,558
Isn't that unbelievable?

324
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,353
Our lives are trapped, beyond our control,

325
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,314
in this day and age.

326
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,693
But when I read,

327
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,530
the great figures from the past
engage me in conversation.

328
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,950
At that moment, I can escape the present.

329
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,245
Thoughts put into writing
remain after we are gone,

330
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,707
and they might spur someone
into action far in the future.

331
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,501
What else could you call that

332
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,170
but a miracle?

333
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,882
It's... that great?

334
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,634
Yes. It is.

335
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:59,461
Finally... I can finally tell you.

336
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,883
The truth.

337
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,957
