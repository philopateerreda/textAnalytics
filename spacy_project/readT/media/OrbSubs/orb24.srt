1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,672
As long as I can make a living,
I'm satisfied.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,341
I don't want anything else.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,468
Wait a second!

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,931
If that's the case, why haven't you
thrown away your astrolabe?

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,271
I was thinking of selling it
at some point.

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,690
Just now,

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:27,318
I said that I baked bread
according to your calculations.

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,779
- But in fact, that's a lie.
- Huh?

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,781
The truth is,

10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,118
I've been baking batches
that are a little higher quality

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,369
than your figures.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,205
Small changes to the recipe

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,042
or the way it's sifted
can change the taste.

14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,836
To avoid the authorities catching on,

15
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,714
I've done so without raising the price.

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,385
Do you know why I would take such a risk?

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,098
Because baking bread is what I love.

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,392
And serving it too, of course.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,521
But then, you can't say the same, can you?

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,901
As long as you can make a living,
you're satisfied?

21
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,695
That's an awful lie.

22
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,908
Because it's yourself,
not me, that you're lying to.

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,871
Your father told me something, long ago.

24
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,957
A wise man in some far-off time and place,

25
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,796
someone named Socrates
or Aristo-something once said,

26
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,633
"All things have <i>arete</i>."

27
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,010
Some inherent potential

28
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,055
or function only they can realize.

29
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,308
A bird's <i>arete</i> is flight.

30
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,812
A chair's <i>arete</i> is that it can be sat on.

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,815
According to those philosophers,

32
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,026
a human's <i>arete</i> is their ability to think.

33
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,530
With that in mind,

34
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,407
my <i>arete</i> is baking bread.

35
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,785
So what's yours?

36
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,040
This Aristo-something-or-other
had another idea.

37
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,544
"Human beings are happiest
when they delight in

38
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,838
that which is best and most akin to them."

39
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,007
The things that interest you

40
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,802
are the mission that God has granted you.

41
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,596
They're how you remain true to yourself.

42
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,598
So don't hide them.

43
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,143
Dive in while you're still young.

44
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,937
No one will complain about that.

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,855
But...

46
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,275
Well, that last part wasn't quite right.

47
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,236
A lot of people might complain.

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,155
But it doesn't matter.

49
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,322
Move forward.

50
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,826
Anyway, it's up to you.

51
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,726
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

52
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,460
{\an8}Hey, Albert!

53
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,461
{\an8}EPISODE 24
THAUMAZEIN

54
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,464
{\an8}Deliver this bread
to the church at this address.

55
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,175
{\an8}Not the usual one?

56
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,510
No.

57
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,389
I recently met the new priest
who resides there.

58
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,225
I promised him a delivery
from my next batch.

59
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,270
It's not that far away. I'd appreciate it.

60
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,938
Very well.

61
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,823
Is this it?

62
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,747
Excuse me!

63
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,379
There's no one here.

64
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,129
Welcome to the confessional.

65
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,132
I'm the priest here.

66
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,719
I admire your bravery
in setting foot inside.

67
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,223
C-Confessional?

68
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,140
Yes.

69
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,934
As the name implies,

70
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,937
this is a place for the troubled
to confess their sins.

71
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:40,024
As God's minister, I will grant you
forgiveness and reconciliation.

72
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,946
You mean like the Sacrament of Penance?

73
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,450
I've never seen it done
in a private room like this.

74
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,328
Indeed. I believe it's a novel idea.

75
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,207
However, I expect it
to grow popular in the future.

76
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,459
<i>He's taking this a bit lightly.</i>

77
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,839
Now, then. Please confess your sins.

78
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,592
W-Wait, I only came here
to deliver an order of bread.

79
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,136
There's no need to hesitate.

80
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,431
Or is it that you don't trust me?

81
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,267
Well, uh...

82
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,396
I can't see your face,
and you're oddly persistent.

83
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,984
To be honest, I find it hard to trust you.

84
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,111
That's an unfortunate surprise.

85
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,364
But then, you are my first visitor,

86
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,492
and my nerves may be on edge too.

87
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,995
<i>His nerves are on edge?</i>

88
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,206
Still, this is a precious opportunity.

89
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,877
Don't you have even one worry?

90
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,630
Well, there is one.

91
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,840
What is it?

92
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,470
I guess it's that
I was told to attend university.

93
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,931
You don't want to attend?

94
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,475
No.

95
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,392
Why not?

96
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,687
It's just as the Holy Scripture says.

97
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,272
To put it simply,

98
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,025
the desire to know things is nonsense.

99
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,820
Is there a reason you think that?

100
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
I'd rather forget it.

101
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,492
Anyway, I'll leave the bread here.

102
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,410
Doesn't that mean

103
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,455
you haven't forgotten yet?

104
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,749
How about this?

105
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,126
If it will be of help,

106
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,631
I'm happy to tell you a secret worry
of my own when you're finished.

107
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,009
Why not get it off your chest?

108
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,597
Sometimes, speaking of matters
can bring great relief.

109
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,562
Well... in that case...

110
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,026
I've got nothing else to do.

111
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:47,985
I might as well.

112
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,202
{\an8}First things first.

113
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,411
{\an8}Where are you from?

114
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,497
{\an8}A village far away.

115
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,374
{\an8}Oh? Which one?

116
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,752
A village called Brudzewo.

117
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,170
I see.

118
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,300
{\an8}I was born there
as the son of a free peasant.

119
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,887
{\an8}When I was young, my mother

120
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,514
{\an8}passed away.

121
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,560
{\an8}After that, my father
raised me on his own.

122
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,438
Did something happen
when you were a child?

123
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,858
My father

124
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,444
placed importance on learning.

125
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,573
There's one thing he told me
again and again.

126
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,950
I still remember it by heart.

127
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,369
"My son,

128
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,123
we are forced to endure a hard life."

129
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,878
"But there are many others
whose lives are much harder."

130
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,174
"There are those who say
farmers like us don't need education."

131
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,510
"But that's not the case."

132
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,806
"If every person grows smarter,
and we work together,

133
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,476
then someday, we can surely create a world

134
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,062
where no one suffers,
and we all live comfortably."

135
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,524
"That's the reason we learn," he said.

136
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,778
He was fortunate to earn praise
from a village elder

137
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,740
who was impressed with his attitude.

138
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,952
He was allowed to read books
most commoners never see.

139
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,874
He brought all the books home,
no matter what the subject.

140
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,460
{\an8}At that time, my father

141
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,214
{\an8}could never have imagined
it would be the root of his demise.

142
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:38,721
In any case, that's why
I learned to read at an early age.

143
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,141
We also had an astrolabe at home,

144
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,645
and I would record
observations with it every night.

145
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,231
You enjoyed observing the heavens?

146
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,279
Yes, back then I did.

147
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,536
{\an8}<i>In those days, I was practically
obsessed with the night sky.</i>

148
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,623
<i>Like a fool, I never tired of it.</i>

149
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,333
<i>I gazed upward every night.</i>

150
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,127
<i>I can't explain why,</i>

151
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,712
<i>but somehow,</i>

152
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,173
<i>it stirred my heart.</i>

153
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,222
Father! I made a surprising discovery!

154
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,474
What is it?

155
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,935
To the north, right above us,

156
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,229
there's a star that never moves!

157
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,022
Is that so?

158
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,858
That's the one they call Polaris.

159
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,610
Polaris?

160
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,113
Tell me then, my son.

161
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,700
What use does that discovery serve?

162
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,576
Huh?

163
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,622
For example, a star that doesn't move

164
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,752
is very useful for navigation,
like a map of the sky.

165
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,046
It's only when

166
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,758
discoveries are useful in that way
that they have meaning.

167
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,386
Without that, they're a waste.

168
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,180
You should always be aware of that.

169
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,600
Still,

170
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,104
you did well to discover that, my son.

171
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,772
I'm proud of you.

172
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,361
Do you enjoy studying?

173
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,655
Yes, Father.

174
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,115
What do you want to know?

175
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,413
Well... everything.

176
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,376
The night sky always surprises me!

177
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,296
Why are there stars up there?

178
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,381
Why do they only come out at night?

179
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,050
How many are there? Where are they?

180
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,762
When did they appear? And for how long?

181
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,139
In the first place, what are stars?

182
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,016
There's so much I want to know!

183
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,186
And why do you want to know?

184
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,228
{\an8}What?

185
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,359
I don't know why.

186
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,988
But I can feel it in my heart.

187
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,115
I want to know.

188
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,285
It's your own desire, then?

189
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,203
Huh?

190
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,914
My son.

191
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,209
From now on, whenever you learn

192
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,211
or feel the desire to know,

193
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,546
remember this.

194
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,842
You must doubt.

195
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,263
Doubt your own knowledge,
conventional wisdom,

196
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,307
and even motives and means.

197
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,019
The pursuit of knowledge
can grow beyond control.

198
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,231
It can become an incurable monster

199
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,610
that can bring
irreversible change to the world.

200
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,614
Take time to doubt the path you're on,

201
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,034
and if it doesn't serve humankind,
then go no further.

202
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,873
But if you still want to learn,

203
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,377
I'll arrange a tutor just for you.

204
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,004
Y-You mean it?

205
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,673
Yes.

206
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,843
This isn't something just anyone can have.

207
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,429
You must show proper gratitude to God.

208
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,895
That's when I met him.

209
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,523
My teacher.

210
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,150
Albert,

211
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:25,614
this is the tutor I told you about before.

212
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,244
His name is Rafal.

213
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

214
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,751
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

215
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,300
Let's see.

216
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,551
You were close.

217
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,845
Maybe this one was a little too hard.

218
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,851
Okay, this is a good place
to take a break.

219
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,060
R-Right.

220
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,231
By the way,

221
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,442
I saw an astrolabe in your room.

222
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,193
Do you stargaze?

223
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,612
Uh, yes.

224
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,406
I keep a record every day.

225
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,450
That's excellent.

226
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,911
Do you like to gaze at the stars too?

227
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,497
I wouldn't say I "like" it.

228
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,545
I love it.

229
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,217
I was born in somewhat
special circumstances.

230
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,178
I had no parents.

231
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,390
Fortunately, I was taken in by a scholar,

232
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,643
and I had an affluent lifestyle.

233
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,687
But I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't lonely.

234
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,315
It was the stars

235
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,359
that saved me then.

236
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,236
As for why,

237
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,698
I realized something one day
while I gazed at the sky.

238
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,077
{\an8}I realized that a world exists

239
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,079
{\an8}beyond our own.

240
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,333
We're not alone.

241
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,044
The feeling excited me.

242
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,171
What's more,

243
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,757
all the stars occupy the same sky.

244
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,719
We must be connected by something bigger.

245
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,056
Connected by some form of truth.

246
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,978
I decided to live on
and find out what that is.

247
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,110
- But I...
- Huh?

248
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,863
I don't have any big goals like that.

249
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:35,160
The records I make
aren't useful for anything.

250
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,163
They can't help anyone

251
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,582
or serve the faith.

252
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,544
That means they're meaningless.

253
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,379
Meaningless?

254
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,465
So then, why keep records every day?

255
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,969
Well, I don't know why.

256
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,888
{\an8}I just want to know...

257
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,727
But I can't keep doing it
for selfish reasons like that.

258
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,356
Albert, take a look at Sagittarius.

259
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,568
Huh? Sagittarius?

260
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,111
What is that?

261
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,573
You made observations
without knowing the constellations?

262
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,242
That's pretty bold for a child.

263
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,454
In that case, follow my finger.

264
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,250
Over there is his head.

265
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,753
And there is his bow.

266
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,921
This is his torso.

267
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,466
The last point here

268
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,217
is where we draw his legs.

269
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,769
What do you think?

270
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,897
Doesn't it look like
a centaur with a bow and arrow?

271
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,649
No.

272
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,862
It doesn't?
Well, it is a bit of a stretch.

273
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,989
S-Sorry.

274
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,951
Even so, isn't it easier to remember now?

275
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,081
If you draw connections
between disorderly points,

276
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,293
you'll see things
that you didn't see before.

277
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,343
How do people come up with such things?

278
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,471
Just how do our powers of reason work?

279
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,851
In Ancient Greece, the constellations
were associated with myths.

280
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,355
Each one has a different story.

281
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,776
Sagittarius is associated
with Chiron, the centaur sage.

282
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,279
A sage is an explorer.

283
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,782
They never bow to challenges

284
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,536
and passionately pursue universal truths.

285
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,706
Do you understand how that feels?

286
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,793
Don't the stars make you feel it too?

287
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,838
<i>Thaumazein</i>.

288
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,925
<i>Thaumazein?</i>

289
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,304
Yes, according to
the ancient philosophers,

290
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,182
philosophy begins with wonder.

291
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:09,773
We feel it when our bodies shudder
in response to the beauty of the universe

292
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:15,571
and when our spirit compels us
to get closer to that beauty.

293
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,573
In other words,

294
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,326
it's the urge to stop and question.

295
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,373
God created this world,

296
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,084
and humankind seeks to understand it.

297
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,463
I know of no nobler desire.

298
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,301
To succeed in that quest,

299
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,344
I'll pay any price.

300
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,099
Even if that price is life.

301
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,565
I'll gladly toss it aside.

302
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,988
You said you were worried, right?

303
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,160
You don't know
if what you're doing is useful.

304
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,539
You also said
that the vague desire to learn

305
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,126
is meaningless and wrong.

306
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,046
In response,

307
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,591
I'm going to say something
quite inappropriate.

308
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:24,264
The idea that knowledge must be useful
to other people or to society

309
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,224
is nonsense.

310
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,894
Do it because you want to know.

311
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,812
That's all that matters.

312
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,191
And then, Albert,

313
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,360
remember this.

314
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,198
When it comes to the pursuit of truth,
one thing is most important.

315
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,243
You must believe.

316
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,164
In your intuition,

317
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,333
in the beauty of this world.

318
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,419
No matter what happens,

319
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,214
I'll never criticize your curiosity.

320
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,553
I've talked for too long.

321
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,973
Let's move on to the next lesson.

322
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,975
I guess we'll try algebra now.

323
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,893
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

324
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,897
Are there other constellations too?

325
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,565
How many?

326
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,317
What kind?

327
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,655
If you don't mind,
would you teach me more next time?

328
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,492
Yes, of course.

329
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,789
This is astonishing.

330
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,583
You've improved so much.

331
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,876
It's remarkable.

332
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,921
You've even mastered quadrature.

333
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,215
Thanks.

334
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,051
Did something change?

335
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,222
Well, it's like...

336
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,142
After what you told me,

337
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,644
I realized that mastering numbers

338
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,564
would bring me closer
to the secrets of the cosmos.

339
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,483
When I thought that,

340
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,569
it's like the urge
to learn came naturally.

341
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,571
That's wonderful.

342
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,367
Actually, there's a small meeting
happening tomorrow.

343
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,495
Others who share
the same motivation will gather.

344
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,420
The group's creed is
"the free pursuit of truth."

345
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,048
It doesn't matter what you study.

346
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,259
All sorts of ideas and opinions
are shared there.

347
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,139
You can even experiment with thoughts
that would be dangerous elsewhere.

348
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,267
It's really inspiring.

349
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,562
How about it?

350
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,439
You're very young,

351
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,358
but you seem to have what it takes.

352
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,485
Will you attend?

353
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,363
Huh?

354
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,114
You mean it?

355
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,116
I d-definitely want to go!

356
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,952
Yeah? I'm glad.

357
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,040
In that case, I'll tell your father too.

358
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,958
I hope you look forward to it.

359
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,668
I will!

360
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,299
Th-This is...

361
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,427
