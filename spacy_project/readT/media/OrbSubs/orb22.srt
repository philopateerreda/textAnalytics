1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,800
These are all our supplies.

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,058
I'll take a sword.

3
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,523
Okay, Draka. Let's go.

4
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,237
Are you all okay with this?

5
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,072
It's our duty.

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,200
{\an8}Preferences don't matter.

7
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,082
We only just met.

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,752
I don't know any of you,

9
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,004
and you don't know me.

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,426
However, we all knew Jolenta.

11
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,637
{\an8}She promised to loan me

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,599
{\an8}the printing press.

13
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,686
It's up to you
to find something new to sell.

14
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,731
Not a bad deal, I'd say.

15
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,941
Well?

16
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:13,531
She only said that so I would tell her
the contents of the book.

17
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,825
From her perspective,

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,620
it may not have meant much.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,954
But to me,

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:27,337
her voice sounded as if
she was encouraging my way of life

21
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,380
and my future.

22
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,844
I'm sure all of you are here
because, at some moment,

23
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,390
you too felt something like that
from Jolenta and this organization.

24
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,562
So, what I'm trying to say is...

25
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,195
I'll do my duty too.

26
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,198
Good. We're counting on you.

27
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,616
Right.

28
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,767
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

29
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,004
{\an8}EPISODE 22
NEITHER OF YOU WILL BE KNOWN TO HISTORY

30
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:33,922
{\an8}Huh?

31
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,423
What is it?

32
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,928
I can't get that explosion out of my head.

33
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,180
Our enemy

34
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,600
must be willing
to do anything for their cause.

35
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,311
I'm... scared.

36
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,067
In just a few hours,

37
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,319
morning will come, as it always does.

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,613
I hope one day

39
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,699
you too will learn to smile
at the sunrise.

40
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,993
That again?

41
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,829
I told you. I hate the sunrise.

42
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,166
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't repeat yourself.

43
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,334
It's annoying.

44
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,586
I'm not merely repeating myself.

45
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,005
This time, I mean it.

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,715
What? You mean it?

47
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,803
Are you trying to irritate me?

48
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,638
Interpret it however you like,

49
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,682
but it's an expression of my gratitude.

50
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,983
Even if the sunrise means nothing to you,

51
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,362
to me, it's the most wonderful moment
a person can experience.

52
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,948
I wanted to share that with you.

53
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,118
But... why?

54
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,245
Who knows?

55
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,497
However, it's probably because

56
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,918
you and I happened to cross paths.

57
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,688
It's awfully quiet.

58
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,733
I... I'm an inquisitor!

59
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,485
You know why we're here!

60
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,571
Surrender quietly!

61
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,503
Fire!

62
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,593
The <i>testudo</i> formation, huh?

63
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,345
Don't panic.

64
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,097
That formation is vulnerable
to close combat.

65
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,849
- We just--
- Charge!

66
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,477
- Engage them in close combat!
- Yes, sir!

67
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,855
Here they come!

68
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,984
Now!

69
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,911
Attack their right flank more!

70
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,338
Hey!

71
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,965
Damn it. These guys are decoys.

72
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,053
Unhook the carts and take only the horses!

73
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,222
Asch!

74
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,976
Huh? Uh, I... Not me.

75
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,483
Well, I suppose it is my job.

76
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,152
I leave this mess to you.

77
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,787
Damn it. They're gaining on us!

78
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,123
Yes. So it seems.

79
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,624
What do we do?

80
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,423
I've never been afraid
to carry out a decision I made.

81
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,715
What?

82
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,008
That's because

83
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,720
I always thought I was simply obeying
the destiny God gave me.

84
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,598
But right now,

85
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,143
I'm afraid for the first time.

86
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,644
Huh?

87
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,273
I pray for your success!

88
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,400
Schmidt!

89
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,721
I've killed many of your comrades.

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,391
Faith was my motive.

91
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,685
But right now,

92
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,438
my faith is wavering.

93
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,941
The justification I once had
for killing you

94
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,026
is no more.

95
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,112
But even so, I'm going to kill you

96
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,656
for my own selfish reasons.

97
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,200
Forgive me!

98
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,951
What are you babbling about?

99
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,953
Wretched heretic!

100
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,205
Die!

101
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,098
Burn in hell!

102
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,578
He's choking to death on his own blood.

103
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,458
It's just the sort of miserable death
a believer in heliocentrism deserves.

104
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,964
{\an8}Even... so...

105
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,760
{\an8}it's the fate... I... chose.

106
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,202
Who are you?
Why are you here at this hour?

107
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,915
I'm a tinsmith.

108
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,418
Oh? Where's your authorization?

109
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,922
It's these.

110
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,802
Bishop!

111
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,017
What is it?

112
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,436
You better have a good reason
to disturb my sleep.

113
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,895
You have a visitor.

114
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,565
Apparently, it's important.

115
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,319
What sort of visitor?

116
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,612
A woman.

117
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,324
From her clothing,
she appears to be a nomad.

118
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,916
I had a feeling it was you.

119
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,628
It's been a while.

120
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,172
What did you want to speak about?

121
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,884
The future.

122
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,095
Something... profitable.

123
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,600
- Leave us alone.
- Huh?

124
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,935
This is for my ears.

125
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,087
Footprints...

126
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,264
Something profitable, huh?

127
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,016
I'm intrigued.

128
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,602
And? What's your idea?

129
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,230
I'll cut straight to the point.

130
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,816
It's a book.

131
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:36,070
In the future,
as personal property ownership spreads,

132
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,155
I think books will sell well.

133
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,743
Right now, the people desire pleasure

134
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,412
more than religion.

135
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,164
From street performances
to public executions,

136
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,876
you've seen the way
they gather like vultures.

137
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,046
Everyone is starving for stimulation.

138
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,632
That's where books come in.

139
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,636
<i>The written word
can reach the brain directly.</i>

140
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,849
<i>If it becomes easy for people to read,
they'll grow addicted.</i>

141
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,060
<i>You can read anywhere,
and at any time too.</i>

142
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,272
<i>Mass printing with movable type is cheap</i>

143
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,274
<i>and frighteningly easy.</i>

144
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>If it catches on,</i>

145
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,653
<i>the profits could be immense.</i>

146
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,323
That's where I'd like your cooperation.

147
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,576
{\an8}I need access to a printing press

148
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,578
{\an8}and permission to publish.

149
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,830
I won't let them go to waste.

150
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,207
Yeah?

151
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,169
Okay, so what's the book about?

152
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,172
That's the complicated part.

153
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,089
Huh?

154
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,384
It's a sort of cosmological model,

155
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,096
or a certain hypothesis
about nature, you could say.

156
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,015
To put it simply,

157
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,018
it's about the movements of the Earth.

158
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,063
{\an8}Are you... What are you--

159
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,732
Do you think it's blasphemy?

160
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,192
Even so,

161
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,569
I have more to say.

162
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,739
Please think about it.

163
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,073
Have you ever heard

164
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:07,328
of a historical precedent
for heliocentrism being suppressed?

165
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,705
Is heliocentrism

166
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,499
really blasphemy?

167
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,669
What? Of course it is.

168
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,463
Spare me the jokes.

169
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,632
Well, this was a waste of time.

170
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,968
Before I send you to the dungeon,
I'll let you in on something.

171
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,348
My father sentenced many people
to death for heliocentrism in the past.

172
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,892
To continue its suppression, he...

173
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,437
Wait.

174
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,564
{\an8}When you put it that way,

175
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,068
{\an8}I've never heard of it
being suppressed elsewhere.

176
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,238
I knew it!

177
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,574
{\an8}The words create an impression,

178
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,827
{\an8}and everyone avoids it out of fear.

179
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,373
When I first learned of it,
I thought it sounded dangerous too.

180
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,877
After all, cosmology
runs counter to divine creation.

181
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,213
Avoiding it seems obvious.

182
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,258
You could be punished for that,

183
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,385
and one has to be careful.

184
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,304
But... But then...

185
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,890
As long as you're careful,

186
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,228
is there any reason
it should be absolutely forbidden?

187
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,438
And couldn't it be

188
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,108
a subject that stimulates enjoyment?

189
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,031
In other words, you believe

190
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,576
that whether heliocentrism is blasphemy

191
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:33,038
could change at the discretion
of whoever is in power at the time?

192
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,332
Yes. Exactly.

193
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,627
Very well.

194
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,463
{\an8}But you should understand this.

195
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,760
{\an8}If the winds shift against us,
I'll cut you off with no second thoughts.

196
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,432
Then that means--

197
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,558
Slow down.

198
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,561
We haven't talked about the profit ratio.

199
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,069
Fifty-fifty.

200
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,405
You must be kidding.

201
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,574
Consider the compromise I'm making.

202
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,161
Eighty-twenty.

203
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,666
Understood.

204
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,920
Then I'll be going.

205
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,796
That should settle everything.

206
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,175
Th-Thank you very much!

207
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,766
- One more thing.
- Huh?

208
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,018
To commemorate the publishing,

209
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,187
there's a letter I'd like to send.

210
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,271
Do you mind?

211
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,691
In that case, use my carrier pigeon.

212
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,735
I'll summon for it now.

213
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,030
Who goes there?

214
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,785
I'm cooperating
with a heretic investigation.

215
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,119
Here is my authorization.

216
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,040
I followed my suspect's footprints here.

217
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,668
Has anyone suspicious come around?

218
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,797
- Actually, there was a woman just now.
- A woman?

219
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,799
Which way did she go?

220
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,716
Huh?

221
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,760
Toward the church.

222
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,428
The church?

223
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,602
Is there a place near here
where I can get a stiff drink?

224
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,231
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

225
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,148
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

226
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,534
- Huh?
- Huh?

227
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,451
What?

228
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,371
Y-You're...

229
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,791
{\an8}Bishop Antoni?

230
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,925
Is this where you serve as bishop?

231
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,552
It's me, Nowak!

232
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,013
I once served as an inquisitor.

233
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,140
Yes, I remember.

234
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,601
P-Please step away from that woman!

235
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,561
You're in danger!

236
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,271
She's a heretic!

237
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,024
She believes...
in that accursed heliocentric theory.

238
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,359
And?

239
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,070
A... "And"?

240
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,114
I said heliocentrism!

241
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,285
The same theory that
your father was so wary of...

242
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,661
You must remember!

243
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,873
So please step away from her...

244
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,668
Huh?

245
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,004
W-What's going on?

246
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,506
Why have you gone quiet?

247
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,427
No... It can't be.

248
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,263
You can't be serious.

249
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,642
{\an8}Don't tell me you and that heretic...

250
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,520
Just tell me one thing.

251
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,941
What is your understanding
of the problem with heliocentrism?

252
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,110
What?

253
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,906
Th-That's...

254
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,910
Cosmology touches upon divine creation.

255
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,204
The details are...

256
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,372
Well...

257
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,875
The previous Bishop said--

258
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,877
Quite vague, wouldn't you say?

259
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,880
Listen, Nowak.

260
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,466
If you fail to understand,
then I'll be clear.

261
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,595
If you're going to label, torture,
and kill people as heretics,

262
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,266
you should learn for yourself
whether such steps are justified.

263
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,769
Take responsibility for your actions.

264
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,396
Justified? But...

265
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,775
Th-That's right. The Holy Scripture says...

266
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,323
"You established the earth,
and it endures."

267
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,991
Or perhaps,

268
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,912
"The world is firmly established;
it cannot be moved."

269
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,624
Are those the verses that come to mind?

270
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,336
Well, if you stop and think clearly,

271
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:54,299
those verses aren't enough to prove
that heliocentrism is blasphemy.

272
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,177
That's because

273
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,890
even heliocentrism is just
one hypothesis among many.

274
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,228
Perhaps it's too uncertain
to call it the one and only truth,

275
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,190
but in the end, it's merely
a mathematical postulate.

276
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,402
What in the world is wrong with that?

277
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,946
In fact,

278
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,700
even if it were proven
that the Earth is moving,

279
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,536
rereading the Holy Scripture
with that in mind

280
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,790
and providing the proper interpretation
is our work as theologians.

281
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,712
Rather than reject
new opinions or discoveries,

282
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,632
we must explore them
to better understand the Holy Scripture.

283
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,051
Isn't that stance

284
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,054
what our faith needs the most now?

285
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,764
On the contrary,

286
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,852
placing the Sun
at the center of the universe

287
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,689
could be seen as natural scientific proof
of the Holy Trinity.

288
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,275
From a theological perspective,

289
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,653
it could be a wonderful discovery
that reveals God's glory.

290
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,990
B-But...

291
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,785
Your father...

292
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,787
Yes.

293
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,208
My father was strict about cosmology.

294
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,126
I don't know the reason,

295
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,213
but as I'm sure you're aware,

296
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,258
he once studied astronomy too.

297
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,222
While doing so,
perhaps he experienced some setback

298
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:28,060
that changed his reverence for the heavens
into an inferiority complex.

299
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,604
Either way,

300
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,690
I imagine the story
goes something like this.

301
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,485
<i>Somewhere in the world,</i>

302
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,696
<i>there was an authority
who had a strict view of cosmology.</i>

303
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,743
<i>Scholars researching heliocentrism
had the misfortune of serving under him</i>

304
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,037
<i>and were branded as heretics.</i>

305
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,335
<i>People then began to believe the myth
that heliocentrism was a forbidden topic.</i>

306
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,422
<i>The dirty work of that operation</i>

307
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,343
<i>could not be entrusted
to an inquisitor from the clergy.</i>

308
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,136
<i>It was contracted out.</i>

309
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,681
<i>In other words, it was entrusted to you,</i>

310
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,307
a former mercenary.

311
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,978
{\an8}If that's what happened,

312
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:16,358
{\an8}this entire scandal was not a crusade
to protect the Church or the faithful.

313
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,902
It was merely a misunderstanding

314
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,905
created by a small group of people.

315
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,077
A misunderstanding?

316
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,620
How can you pass this off

317
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,123
as just a misunderstanding?!

318
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,295
{\an8}Hubert, Rafal, Oczy, Badeni!

319
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,172
{\an8}These men were executed
for researching heliocentrism,

320
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,466
{\an8}and they were killed by me!

321
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,303
N-Not to mention...

322
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,473
my daughter...

323
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,645
That's right, the records!
There are records--

324
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,565
None of the executions were made public.

325
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,153
Besides, it was more than 25 years ago.

326
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,572
Who knows if the records remain?

327
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,991
Looking back, it was strange.

328
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,704
Far too many of your cosmology executions
were filed away as confidential.

329
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,999
Still, I'm a cautious man.

330
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:18,378
Just now, I ordered my men
to look up your remaining records

331
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,381
and destroy any that were found.

332
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,135
By tomorrow morning, they'll all be gone.

333
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,103
{\an8}Was I really...

334
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,149
Was I really the only one?

335
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,694
In all the world, the only one...

336
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,240
who actually suppressed
heliocentrism was me?

337
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,034
Yes.

338
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,619
To the best of my knowledge.

339
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,956
After all this time... you expect me to...

340
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,420
Had we been born elsewhere,

341
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,298
or at another time,

342
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,134
there were other possibilities.

343
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,554
However, that is not the case.

344
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,933
That's what we call fate.

345
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,811
It's unfortunate,

346
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,813
but you'll have to accept it.

347
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,401
<i>When it comes to you
and the heretics you executed</i>...

348
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,490
<i>neither of you will be known to history.</i>

349
