1
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,678
Another rough day ahead.

2
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,763
We're sure to be yelled at again.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,681
Huh?

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,932
Hey!

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,435
You're not permitted, Jolenta.

6
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,272
Yes, I know.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,190
You do, huh?

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,455
<i>God, please don't let me be caught.</i>

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,165
<i>Don't let me be caught.</i>

10
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,001
<i>Why am I doing this?</i>

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,336
<i>I still have time to turn back and yet...</i>

12
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,091
<i>Better not get my gloves dirty.</i>

13
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,721
<i>I don't feel lucky today.</i>

14
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,723
<i>I'm gonna get caught.</i>

15
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,821
<i>My luck has run out.</i>

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>I just know it.</i>

17
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,492
<i>God has abandoned me for sure.</i>

18
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,080
Oh, Count Piast.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,331
Good morning, sir.

20
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,458
<i>I made it in time!</i>

21
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,126
Skip the pleasantries!

22
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,840
You've wasted enough of my remaining years
with your tedious treatise!

23
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,634
F-Forgive me, my lord.

24
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,968
Well then,

25
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,679
now that Count Piast is here,
we can discuss...

26
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,981
<i>What? The Arabian heretics
have revised ancient Greek astronomy?</i>

27
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,442
<i>I could never hear this anywhere else!</i>

28
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,570
<i>Dear God,</i>

29
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,989
<i>I am lucky indeed.</i>

30
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,765
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

31
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,125
{\an8}EPISODE SEVEN
MATTERS OF THE TRUTH

32
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,960
{\an8}He was as severe as ever today.

33
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,878
{\an8}Yeah.

34
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,795
{\an8}Welcome back!

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,547
Huh?

36
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,720
I really do envy you.

37
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,805
You got to rest this whole time.

38
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,558
In that case,

39
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,685
please consider my request

40
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,480
to take part in the discussions.

41
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,898
The answer is no.

42
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,610
We don't know yet
if you are truly suited to this work.

43
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,489
<i>After all,</i>

44
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,825
<i>there is an obvious difference
between you and us.</i>

45
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,370
That's...

46
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,748
Oh, Jolenta.

47
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,083
There you are.

48
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,710
Kolbe!

49
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,628
Hi.

50
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,631
Hello. You must be exhausted.

51
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,134
You have it rough too, Kolbe.

52
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,762
With Jolenta as your assistant and all.

53
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,223
Yes, you said it.

54
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,602
Making use of a capable assistant
can be a real dilemma.

55
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,145
Huh?

56
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,063
What?

57
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,193
I'll tell you as many times as it takes.

58
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,862
Throughout your life,

59
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,532
you may meet people

60
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,660
who completely reject you
for illegitimate reasons.

61
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,246
Those moments

62
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,498
may feel heartbreaking.

63
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:55,003
But you must believe in yourself
and move forward.

64
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,131
There are times you can't back down.

65
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,591
I'll do my best to support you.

66
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,261
R-Right.

67
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,347
Anyway,

68
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,891
how's that new treatise coming along?

69
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,519
I completed my first draft.

70
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,104
Really?

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,316
This is it.

72
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
Let's see...

73
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,909
I put everything I know into it.

74
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,994
Fascinating.

75
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,245
Huh?

76
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,582
To write this well at your age is amazing!

77
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,209
R-Really?

78
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,794
That settles it.

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,465
I'll submit this to Count Piast.

80
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,217
To Count Piast?

81
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,260
Yes.

82
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,262
I'll need more time to read it,

83
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,014
so take some time off.

84
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,515
In fact,

85
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,393
why don't you visit your family?

86
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,063
My family? Why?

87
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,273
If this is well-received,

88
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,776
you'll be transferred
from the library to the observatory.

89
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,738
Things will get busy.

90
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,865
Go home while you have the chance.

91
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,117
Uh, right!

92
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,122
Yes!

93
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,833
Point one.

94
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,544
The Sun is at the center of the planets.

95
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,922
Two, orbits are perfect circles.

96
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,467
Three, the planets all move
at a set speed.

97
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,679
In summary, these are the arguments
presented in the documents

98
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,015
and the original ideas therein.

99
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,309
Is it true?

100
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,312
- No, it's merely on the threshold.
- What?

101
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,690
Whoever wrote these had a brilliant mind.

102
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,360
The three ideas I listed

103
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,029
are already quite an accomplishment.

104
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,406
So then--

105
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,117
Even so, I'll be blunt.

106
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,078
The documents aren't nearly ready
to be made public.

107
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,248
They've overlooked something.

108
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,751
At this rate,
the ideas will be easy to refute.

109
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,087
Throughout the documents,

110
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,007
their careful word choice
is outweighed by something at their core.

111
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,010
An almost juvenile naïveté.

112
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,179
How mysterious.

113
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,849
Whoever continues this work

114
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,561
must combine a careful intellect
with bold convictions.

115
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,772
It will take a man of true greatness.

116
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,607
Do you know anyone like that?

117
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,401
Of course. It's me.

118
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,571
With that said,

119
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,239
I accept the task.

120
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,117
Accept?

121
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,496
Isn't that what you came to ask me?

122
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,290
Was that it?

123
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,584
I guess it was.

124
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,545
Fair enough.

125
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,674
Before we proceed,
I'd like you to agree to three conditions.

126
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,301
First,

127
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,219
no successors.

128
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,264
If I can't prove the theory before I die,

129
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,017
you must burn all materials
with my involvement.

130
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,770
What's important

131
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,940
is that <i>I</i> be the one
who finishes and releases it.

132
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,611
I refuse to be a stepping stone
for someone else.

133
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,696
Understood.

134
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,283
Second, you will participate

135
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,202
as an observation assistant.

136
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,664
In return, our church will provide you
with food and lodging.

137
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,667
Do you mean it? Thank you very much.

138
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,794
Now for the final condition.

139
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,507
If all goes well and we profit from this,

140
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,009
we'll split it nine to one.

141
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,303
I get the nine, of course.

142
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,430
That won't do.

143
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,308
We can only receive 90 percent.

144
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,559
What?

145
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,020
Well, it's written here.

146
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,815
We're supposed to give
ten percent of the profits to someone.

147
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,317
Huh?

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,027
"If any profit should be earned,

149
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,404
ten percent should be given to Potocki."

150
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,781
A co-researcher?

151
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,660
So we can only receive 90 percent...

152
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,794
It's gone now.

153
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,047
With that settled,
let's return to the village.

154
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,966
Uh, right.

155
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,393
Excuse me!

156
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,062
Can't we honor the request?

157
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,064
What? Why should we?

158
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,691
It no longer exists.

159
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,861
Yes, but I'll remember it was there.

160
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,532
What's more, whoever wrote that letter

161
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,579
probably put their trust
in the person who would open the chest.

162
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,915
If we ignore the will
of someone who is gone,

163
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,669
I have a feeling
we'll lose something important.

164
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,088
Like what?

165
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,674
History, maybe?

166
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,175
What?

167
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,220
I have no interest in history
other than the holy scripture.

168
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,223
If you're so eager to pay them,

169
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,933
give them your ten percent.

170
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,852
Oh, right.

171
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,439
Um, one last thing.

172
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,316
As a clergyman,

173
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,485
do you think involvement with this

174
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,946
puts us at the entrance to hell?

175
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,326
Well, we're at an entrance all right.

176
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,538
But it's to the heavens.

177
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,961
It's nice to have
family time after so long.

178
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,964
It's been comforting for me too.

179
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,967
You've been busy traveling, Father?

180
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,469
Here and there.

181
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,223
I suppose you have to go back
to your workplace soon.

182
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,976
Yes, I have work to do.

183
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,731
Is that work causing you any concern?

184
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,024
Huh?

185
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,734
It's written on your face.

186
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,197
To be honest, there's a gap
between me and the others.

187
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,199
You can't keep up?

188
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,661
No, it's bigger than that.

189
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,373
They won't let me
conduct research in the first place.

190
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,876
All I ever do is busywork in the library.

191
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,463
I want to work in the astronomy wing.

192
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,342
Isn't the work you have now enough?

193
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,095
It's impressive that you work at all.

194
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,100
Even so, I passed the same exam
as everyone else.

195
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,895
So why am I treated differently?

196
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,314
It is what it is.

197
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,858
You're still 14 years old.

198
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,821
You're also the only woman
who works there.

199
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
A talented woman at that.

200
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,620
Do you realize
how much that worries people?

201
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:50,876
Yes, but... that has nothing to do
with academic research.

202
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,715
Listen, Jolenta.

203
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,009
There's only one thing
for you to do at your workplace.

204
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,387
Nothing.

205
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,682
Don't stand out.

206
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,351
Don't strive for glory.

207
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,939
If you spend your days in solemn modesty,

208
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,358
you'll join your family in heaven one day.

209
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,572
But you gave me these gloves

210
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,782
so that I could study even in winter.

211
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,161
I've been a scholar at heart ever since.

212
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,415
For God and matters of the truth,
I don't want to retreat.

213
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,960
{\an8}Not from my talent, progress, or life.

214
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,755
{\an8}There are times you can't back down.

215
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,552
I understand.

216
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,598
You're an independent woman now.

217
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,893
My parental concern got the best of me.

218
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,561
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,564
Father!

220
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,691
I'm rooting for you.

221
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,568
Thank you very much!

222
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,030
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

223
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:01,947
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

224
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:12,917
I beg you.

225
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,590
- I beg you.
- I beg you.

226
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,093
What are you doing? Let's go.

227
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,096
Yes, sir!

228
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,974
- Charity is meaningless.
- What?

229
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,561
To think that giving alms to the poor
will lead you to heaven

230
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,021
is a ridiculous belief.

231
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,857
They're the biggest sinners of all.

232
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,195
I've never heard
a clergyman talk that way.

233
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,866
It's the fate that God assigned them.

234
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,954
Besides, we're here
to meet with their opposites.

235
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,372
People of means.

236
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,252
If we only have the records in that chest,

237
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,838
we'll never reach a better conclusion.

238
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,842
We need someone
with the means to provide more.

239
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,177
Do you have connections?

240
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,387
No.

241
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,306
They will come to us.

242
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,726
Here we are.

243
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:24,113
Idle nobles and the wealthy
post and solve problems here

244
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,614
as an intellectual game.

245
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,243
The more difficult
the problem, the better.

246
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,036
Then you mean...

247
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,876
I devised this highly advanced problem.

248
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,337
It'll take astronomical records
and keen intellect to solve.

249
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,049
We'll split up and post these
on prominent bulletin boards.

250
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,511
Then we'll wait for someone to answer.

251
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,930
Will someone really come?

252
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,057
That depends on luck.

253
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,934
Let's meet up at sundown.

254
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:15,915
<i>If my treatise is praised,
I'll move to the observatory.</i>

255
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,750
Oh, you're back?

256
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,835
Kolbe!

257
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,753
Hi!

258
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,007
Was my treatise--

259
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,175
About that.

260
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,802
Believe it or not, Count Piast praised it!

261
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,180
He said it was fresh thinking.

262
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,850
This is a great honor.

263
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,644
Your talent has blossomed!

264
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,104
- I, um...
- Huh?

265
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,067
I'm truly grateful.

266
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,111
No, don't thank me.

267
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,697
I submitted it in my name after all.

268
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,699
But it's still your work.

269
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,035
Yes, but you're always so supportive...

270
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,412
- What?
- Huh?

271
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,581
In your name?

272
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,666
As I said,

273
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,502
I submitted it in my name,

274
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,463
but you can be proud that you wrote it.

275
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,173
- What?
- Huh?

276
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,344
You submitted my treatise in your name?

277
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,472
Yes, of course I did.

278
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,517
What do you mean "of course"?

279
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,727
Well, you know.

280
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,814
Who would read a woman's treatise?

281
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,233
But that's...

282
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,567
Huh?

283
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,821
Don't tell me you thought
it would be in your name.

284
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,323
Oh, dear. This is a dilemma.

285
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,409
You're far too naïve.

286
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,998
A treatise by a woman
would be incredibly dangerous.

287
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,543
Any inappropriate content
would bring dire consequences.

288
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,295
You could be accused of witchcraft

289
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,423
or executed as a heretic.

290
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,509
But don't worry.

291
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,929
I won't let that happen.

292
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,764
You have great talent.

293
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,059
So, you'll write, and I'll publish.

294
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,729
If I earn enough praise,

295
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,024
I can safely bring you to the observatory.

296
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,279
Stick with me,
and I'll point you in the right direction.

297
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,866
<i>I'll teach you
how to live smart in this world.</i>

298
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,870
But in that world,

299
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,165
my name...

300
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,793
It won't remain.

301
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,921
Give up on that. It's the way things are.

302
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,092
Your name may not remain,

303
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,095
but at least you can publish
your thoughts, right?

304
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,308
Your naïveté worries me.

305
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,894
If you attract the wrong attention,

306
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,396
your life could end in a flash.

307
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,941
Anyway, I'll be waiting for your next one.

308
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,401
Farewell.

309
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,319
Wait!

310
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,906
Count Piast!

311
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,826
You honor us with your presence.

312
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,329
Hey, you.

313
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,371
What?

314
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,374
Did I hear you say

315
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,460
that you wrote that treatise?

316
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,962
My lord, that's uh--

317
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,256
I want her to answer.

318
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,508
Did you?

319
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,677
Th-That's...

320
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,231
I, uh...

321
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,943
A treatise by a woman
would be incredibly dangerous.

322
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,155
<i>But there are times I can't back down.</i>

323
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,991
Do nothing. Don't stand out.

324
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,910
<i>If I back down...</i>

325
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,163
Your life could end in a flash.

326
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,915
<i>If I back down...</i>

327
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,043
Who would read a woman's treatise?

328
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,047
It...

329
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,009
It wasn't me.

330
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,681
I see.

331
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,443
I knew you were smart.

332
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,955
<i>I... was tricked.</i>

333
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,542
<i>Everything he said was a lie.</i>

334
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,296
<i>Kolbe is a wicked man.</i>

335
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,347
<i>If only... that were true.</i>

336
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,099
<i>Things would be much easier.</i>

337
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,643
<i>But it's not so.</i>

338
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,395
<i>He's a good man.</i>

339
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,857
<i>He really is looking out for me.</i>

340
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,193
<i>This must be</i>

341
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,571
<i>the best I can hope for.</i>

342
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,241
<i>This is my reality.</i>

343
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,205
<i>No, think clearly.</i>

344
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,583
<i>It's enough to have
a safe space for research.</i>

345
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,086
<i>My name isn't important.</i>

346
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,466
<i>I've been childish.</i>

347
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,303
<i>If this is how the world is,
it's important to live smart.</i>

348
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,431
<i>On to the next treatise!</i>

349
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,141
<i>What should I write next?</i>

350
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,267
<i>Next...</i>

351
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,604
<i>Why am I crying?</i>

352
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,522
<i>Tears aren't necessary!</i>

353
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,150
<i>If I cry, it's like I've lost!</i>

354
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,819
<i>If I cry, it's like there's a problem!</i>

355
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,617
<i>I just have to move on.</i>

356
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,036
<i>That's all I can do now.</i>

357
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,540
<i>I'd better search for new subject matter.</i>

358
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,297
"Dear reader,

359
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,300
we have a need for theoretical astronomy."

360
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,052
"Please post your response."

361
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,346
What is this?

362
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,727
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

363
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,106
<i>The problem is pretty advanced
for a bulletin board posting.</i>

364
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,733
<i>But wait.</i>

365
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,069
<i>Without astronomical records,</i>

366
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,862
<i>this can't be answered.</i>

367
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:24,950
Kolbe!

368
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,952
He's not here.

369
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,123
<i>If I act now, I can examine his records!</i>

370
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,084
Here we go.

371
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,463
These are records of Jupiter. How cool.

372
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,509
Everyone else has free access
to all these records.

373
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,762
<i>Wait, right now,</i>

374
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,848
<i>I think I'm doing something bad.</i>

375
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,601
<i>No, it's definitely bad. Unthinkable!</i>

376
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,064
<i>But this might help me
write a new treatise.</i>

377
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,526
<i>That could help Kolbe earn more praise.</i>

378
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:04,448
<i>Then again, if someone
spots me in here, I'm finished.</i>

379
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,200
<i>Even Kolbe would abandon me.</i>

380
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,165
<i>Yeah.</i>

381
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,666
<i>This is wrong.</i>

382
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,835
{\an8}<i>It's wrong. I can't do it.</i>

383
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,301
<i>But I don't care if it's wrong.</i>

384
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,969
<i>I want to know the answer!</i>

385
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,015
<i>Forget it. Answer first, think later.</i>

386
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,730
I've finished posting.

387
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,106
Good.

388
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,276
What is it?

389
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,279
There's someone standing

390
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,822
in front of your problem.

391
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,034
Could someone be posting a reply?

392
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,660
What? Already?

393
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,746
We only posted it this morning.

394
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,170
<i>I answered it.</i>

395
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,589
<i>It should be okay, right?</i>

396
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,091
<i>I used a man's name.</i>

397
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,594
<i>But if someone were to see me...</i>

398
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,639
<i>If it's causing me this much anxiety,</i>

399
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,183
<i>I should have thought before I acted.</i>

400
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,187
<i>Keep this up, and I'll be caught one day.</i>

401
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,233
<i>I'd better go before someone sees me.</i>

402
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,317
Excuse me!

403
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,917
