1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:08,967
This is the leader
of the Heretic Liberation Front...

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,553
Jolenta.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,724
I'm glad you're all safe.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,356
I know I should ask who that girl is.

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,360
But first, where's the book?

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,779
About that...

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,908
Due to my shortcomings,
she got away with burning it.

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,830
However, she says
she memorized the book's contents.

9
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,373
It's true!

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,668
I'm Draka. Pleased to meet you.

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,338
Oh?

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,799
Well then, Draka.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,176
Come with me.

14
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,789
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

15
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,694
{\an8}EPISODE 19
WANDERING IS HOW YOU FIND WHAT'S RIGHT

16
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,744
Hey there!

17
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,331
What a nuisance.

18
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,834
He passed out just from that?

19
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,545
- Hey, Asch!
- Huh?

20
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,213
May we speak?

21
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,757
Perfect timing.
I wanted to speak with you too,

22
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,634
Bishop Damian.

23
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,972
You ordered burnings
at the stake again, didn't you?

24
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,183
And torture like this!

25
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,517
What about it?

26
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,937
I serve directly under the Holy Father.

27
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,733
I don't need authorization
from a bishop like you.

28
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,527
Yes, that's true.

29
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,780
But you've clearly gone too far.

30
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,327
You're supposed to
gently guide them toward recantation.

31
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,663
I've tried all of that.

32
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,540
But it was no use.

33
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,293
Besides, have you forgotten history?

34
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,506
200 years ago, when dedicated monks
taught them the error of their ways,

35
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,092
the heretics responded by throwing stones.

36
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,805
Around that same time,
they even killed an envoy of the Emperor.

37
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,434
The minute you go soft on them,
that's how they act.

38
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,312
It's you who should read more history.

39
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,316
That was only 200 years ago.

40
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,819
Go back further, to 500 years ago,

41
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,906
and you'll find that the Archbishop

42
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,200
once defended accused witches from a mob.

43
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,785
And 400 years ago,

44
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,455
a sorcerer once rose to become Emperor.

45
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:14,504
The Church of old treated those accused
of heresy or sorcery with moderation.

46
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,130
I don't get it.

47
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,466
Why are you so timid?

48
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,763
At this very moment, the Reformation
and the heretical groups who followed them

49
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,682
are attacking the Church orthodoxy.

50
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,059
Our followers are all frightened.

51
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,562
If we don't act now to defend the faith,

52
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,314
how can we call ourselves clergy?

53
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,651
I too...

54
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,738
{\an8}When I was younger,

55
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,658
{\an8}I too felt the same sense of urgency.

56
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,246
{\an8}But having lived longer,
I've seen many things,

57
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,831
{\an8}and I've realized something.

58
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:55,211
These methods cannot be changing
the world for the better.

59
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,797
As you say,

60
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,385
the Church orthodoxy
has grown remarkably weaker.

61
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,721
But what good will conflict do?

62
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,182
Rather than killing others,

63
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,727
it's better to die defending the Church.

64
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,772
There can be no salvation
built on terror and torture.

65
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,608
Love those with different beliefs!

66
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,280
Submerge him.

67
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,284
Are you finished?

68
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,120
If so, it's my turn.

69
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,999
Just the other day,
an inquisition chamber was attacked.

70
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,878
A total of ten men perished,
including guards and an inquisitor.

71
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,466
Their tactics indicate
it was the Heretic Liberation Front.

72
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,344
But something else caught our attention.

73
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,723
They stole a book that we had confiscated.

74
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,392
A book? What book?

75
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,395
Something about "heliocentrism."

76
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,733
We confiscated the book
nearly one year ago.

77
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,527
I'm told it was found
in an abandoned church.

78
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,364
The book seems fairly old,

79
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,867
but there was no indication
of who wrote it or when.

80
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,246
Our only hint was the final passage
and an accompanying address.

81
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,124
It said, "Give ten percent to Potocki."

82
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,211
But when we looked into it,

83
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,089
the man named Potocki had died long ago.

84
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:26,594
Only a citizen with no relation
lives at the address now.

85
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,846
It's quite a mystery.

86
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:34,685
Potocki is a man who was arrested
for researching heliocentrism.

87
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,229
What?

88
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,688
Years later,

89
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,901
heliocentrism also led to the death
of his pupil and his adopted son.

90
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,988
That was 35 years ago. It was my case.

91
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,951
But why, after all these years?

92
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,661
Who could have written it?

93
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,620
Uh, what?

94
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,289
Was it those two young men
from the village?

95
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,835
No, they died 25 years ago too.

96
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,171
If I may, what I wanted to ask about

97
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,591
was finding someone well-versed
in cosmology for the investigation.

98
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,137
Do you know of anyone?

99
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,474
Cosmology, eh?

100
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,356
<i>At a bar on the edge of town,</i>

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,359
<i>you'll find a certain former inquisitor.</i>

102
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,487
Um, excuse me.

103
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,282
Bishop Damian sent me.

104
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,371
Are you Nowak?

105
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,915
Who are you?

106
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,713
Oh, uh, my name is Asch.

107
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,173
I'm an inquisitor.

108
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,801
- Will you...
- Huh?

109
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,345
Will you buy me a drink?

110
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,097
No, uh...

111
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,308
This is about work. I'm not here to drink.

112
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,482
Um, sir?

113
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,319
Who are you?

114
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,824
I'm Asch, an inquisitor.

115
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,453
I'd like to ask for your help
with a recent incident.

116
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,789
Huh? An inquisitor?

117
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,583
You?

118
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,834
Yes.

119
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,047
You're really an inquisitor?

120
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,174
That makes you my junior.

121
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,134
You're a novice, aren't you?

122
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,763
In that case,
I'll let you in on something.

123
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,475
You know the bishop Damian, right?

124
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,354
He was once my subordinate.

125
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,566
And since he owes me for back then,

126
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,695
he employs me personally now.

127
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,448
In other words, I've reached the point

128
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,451
where I earn money without working.

129
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,869
Do you get it?

130
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,996
I don't have to work.

131
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,376
So I won't be discussing a job with you.

132
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,586
Run along now.

133
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,631
I've got no use for someone
who won't buy me a drink.

134
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,717
It was Damian who sent me.

135
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,762
Oh, yeah? Well, you can leave.

136
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,891
Everyone has a past.

137
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,020
He is another man whose life
was ruined by heliocentrism.

138
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,484
It's about the heliocentrism case
you worked on 35 years ago.

139
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,489
What?

140
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,742
You're an expert in cosmology, right?

141
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,246
Recently, a book was stolen
from our inquisition chamber.

142
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,876
The book is likely related
to the case you worked on.

143
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,504
That's impossible.

144
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,715
And yet, it's true.

145
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,509
Leave.

146
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,261
- But--
- Just go!

147
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,184
E-Excuse me, then.

148
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,654
<i>It can't be.</i>

149
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,657
<i>All is said and done.</i>

150
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,792
<i>I brought it to an end long ago.</i>

151
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,506
<i>It dares to reemerge
after all these years?</i>

152
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,343
When my...

153
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,181
When my daughter is still dead?!

154
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,559
Your enemy is a resilient one.

155
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,439
So what?

156
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,778
What was that about?
He was just an old drunk!

157
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,989
Wait.

158
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,870
Huh? Oh, uh, hello.

159
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,331
Have you narrowed the list of suspects?

160
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,833
Uh, y-yes.

161
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,504
We believe it was the work
of the Heretic Liberation Front.

162
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,882
Allow me to join the investigation.

163
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,720
I'll need information
on the Heretic Liberation Front.

164
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,390
Have you identified their leader?

165
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,849
Yes.

166
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,144
There's conflicting information,
but we believe it's a woman.

167
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,022
How tragic.

168
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,859
She surely could have lived a safer life.

169
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,155
- Has anyone seen her face?
- A few men have.

170
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,617
According to their statements,
she's missing a tooth.

171
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,370
Awfully careless.

172
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,456
However, we don't know where they fled

173
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,874
or what their goal is.

174
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:54,296
Why would an organization
that frees heretics go after a book?

175
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,386
When you reach a dead end,
rethink your assumptions.

176
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,138
Huh?

177
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,182
Let's assume liberating heretics
is not their goal,

178
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,435
but a means to an end.

179
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,354
What if their true goal

180
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,275
is to overthrow the Church orthodoxy?

181
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,486
The book would be an effective tool.

182
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:23,534
Books can be an efficient way
to change people's way of thinking.

183
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,037
Far more so than traveling to preach.

184
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,665
But how would they reproduce it?

185
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,459
Asch.

186
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,171
An inquisitor should be well aware
of the latest technology.

187
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,009
New technology
is always used for evil first.

188
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,346
In this case, a new printing method
for mass-producing books

189
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,932
called movable type may be involved.

190
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,562
In other words,
if we combine all of my hypotheses,

191
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:56,567
it's likely that they're planning
to publish that book.

192
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,028
If you agree,

193
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,948
then immediately begin questioning
printers and typeface craftsmen.

194
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,075
They may also make their own machine

195
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,995
to avoid leaving a trail.

196
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,083
Ask about people or places
that recently purchased a winepress

197
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,585
or large amounts of lead.

198
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,337
Uh, right!

199
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,883
Oh, and uh...
I'm grateful for your cooperation.

200
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,009
Huh?

201
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,594
I don't know the details,

202
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,180
but I heard you have a complicated past.

203
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,558
To be honest, I underestimated you.

204
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,395
But now that you've risen
to help us defeat these heretics,

205
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,814
I feel reassured.

206
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,068
They're merely being manipulated.

207
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,153
In a way, they're victims.

208
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,198
The true enemy is not them.

209
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,115
Huh?

210
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,286
This is my mission.

211
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,247
It's my fate.

212
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,708
As long as I have life left in me,

213
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,794
I'll follow them as far as it takes.

214
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,921
Until the root of all evil...

215
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,093
Until I erase heliocentrism
once and for all!

216
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,102
Don't move.

217
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,521
You don't have my trust.

218
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,359
Why did you burn the book?

219
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,116
I wanted to know where the book led.

220
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,160
Burning it was the only way
they'd take me.

221
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,913
What is that book to you?

222
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,542
{\an8}I had the feeling
it could make me a lot of money.

223
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,213
Not only that, but you people
also have your hands on a printing press.

224
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,090
I couldn't pass up this chance.

225
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,675
How about this?

226
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:50,055
In exchange for telling you the contents,
I want 20% of the profits.

227
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,390
Will you consider it?

228
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,605
I'll bet people call you brazen.

229
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,190
Is money that important?

230
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,360
Yes.

231
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,404
Oh?

232
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,449
Then I'll tell you
something important too.

233
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,285
The book you burned

234
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,496
was likely written
by an old friend of mine.

235
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,208
Which means that for me,

236
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,878
it was quite significant.

237
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,255
When I learned of its existence,

238
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,966
I even broke out in a fever from surprise.

239
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,474
That's why I don't want you
to treat it as a mere moneymaker.

240
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,935
It's worth more than that.

241
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,187
Come.

242
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,986
At this hour, you can still see the stars.

243
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,489
Do you know your planets?

244
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,742
Um, sort of.

245
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,703
Do you see Saturn there?

246
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,622
Yes.

247
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,209
{\an8}Each planet circles at a different speed.

248
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,629
{\an8}When do you think was the last time

249
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,422
{\an8}Saturn was at these coordinates?

250
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,383
Beats me.

251
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,302
Thirty years ago.

252
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,349
<i>I was nine years old
the last time it was in that spot.</i>

253
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,601
<i>My passion was geometry.</i>

254
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,437
<i>Five years later,</i>

255
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,524
<i>at age 14, I encountered heliocentrism.</i>

256
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,735
<i>Six years later,</i>

257
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,738
<i>at age 20,
I killed someone for the first time.</i>

258
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,949
And now,

259
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,077
at age 39, I've met you,

260
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,246
and Saturn has completed its circuit.

261
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,043
Saturn is the slowest
of the planets we can see.

262
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,756
The reason is likely that
it's the farthest from the sun.

263
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,843
A planet's speed differs with distance.

264
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,013
The universe is governed
by a single order,

265
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,474
proceeding accurately and logically.

266
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,520
The heliocentric theory that you read

267
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,106
gives you a peek at God's greatness.

268
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,901
Is that so?

269
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,738
And... what of it?

270
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,700
Forgive me,
but what are you trying to say?

271
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,662
You can't tell?

272
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm desperately trying

273
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,127
to share how it inspires me.

274
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:31,383
Yes, but why are you sharing it with me?

275
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,887
You're the only person I know of

276
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,348
who has read that book.

277
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,269
You're one of the few
who share my knowledge of heliocentrism.

278
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,856
It's simply because, for whatever reason,

279
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,568
you and I have crossed paths.

280
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,449
I wanted you to hear about
what it's worth to me.

281
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,035
Rather than the money it can make.

282
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,372
You're awfully high-minded.

283
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,292
May I ask a question then?

284
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,795
You seem to belittle making money,

285
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,713
but what about your own actions?

286
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,094
You kill people, free heretics,
and disrupt social order.

287
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,554
Is that something to be proud of?

288
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,389
No.

289
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,809
But I have no second thoughts.

290
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,686
I'm simply reclaiming

291
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,565
the freedom and life
the Church stole from me.

292
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,820
And with it, my father... and friends.

293
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,407
Authorities who suppress
individual freedom should be overthrown.

294
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,078
But aren't you doing the same?

295
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,582
The cessation of thought
that occurs with authority

296
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,876
is not limited to religion.

297
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,130
Doesn't it occur among scholars too?

298
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,632
No.

299
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,761
Or so I'd like to say,
but maybe you're right.

300
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,015
I've killed many times now.

301
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,145
When truth is your shield,
violence can definitely accelerate.

302
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:11,567
Perhaps I have blind faith
in the authority of heliocentrism.

303
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,653
Those who serve me
may have ceased thinking too.

304
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,198
Even sadder,

305
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,367
that may be inevitable.

306
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,952
In other words,

307
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,080
logical thinking requires
a set of assumptions.

308
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,000
It's a fundamental limit of human reason.

309
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,254
Whenever we think,
assumptions of some kind occur,

310
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,381
and those eventually become authority.

311
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,052
Perhaps none of us
can escape that framework.

312
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,182
The passion that runs
beneath those conditions

313
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,976
travels a trajectory that can be reckless.

314
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,478
It can produce beautiful accomplishments

315
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,315
or grotesque tragedies.

316
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,277
How do you know
you're not producing tragedy?

317
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,615
Because I believe
freedom lies at my destination.

318
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,783
How do you define freedom?

319
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,244
The ability to ask that.

320
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,041
Perhaps I've said too much.

321
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,126
Let's head back.

322
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,800
- Captain.
- Yes?

323
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,136
Will we be printing here?

324
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,515
No, we merely came here
to retrieve the typefaces.

325
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,060
The printing press is at our next stop.

326
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,187
We've diffused the risks.

327
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,690
Then our next stop
is the final destination

328
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,943
on our most important mission.

329
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,569
Yes.

330
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,655
And where is that?

331
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,158
Our next destination is...

332
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,577
About your request.

333
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,622
I can't give you 20% of the profits

334
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,042
because I don't plan
to make a profit from this book.

335
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,881
However, I can lend you
our printing press.

336
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,970
It's up to you
to find something new to sell.

337
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,973
Not a bad deal, I'd say.

338
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,808
Well?

339
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,814
Yes. Please allow me to accept.

340
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:15,732
Sure.

341
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,072
Now then, tell me about the book.

342
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,160
{\an8}For the first time in ages,
I want to reunite with my old friend.

343
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,705
{\an8}Right.

344
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,576
That is all.

345
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,083
I was right.

346
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,336
Reading and writing are miracles.

347
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,965
Oh, I forgot to ask.

348
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,636
Why do you want money so badly?

349
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,182
That's because

350
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,976
it's my conviction.

351
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,146
Then it is important.

352
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,231
But sometimes,

353
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,610
you meet something
that makes you forget your convictions.

354
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,446
You should value those feelings too.

355
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,781
Otherwise...

356
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,534
Otherwise?

357
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,788
You'll end up like me.

358
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,335
Conviction can become a curse.

359
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,130
It's both my source of strength
