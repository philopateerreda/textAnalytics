1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,422
It's unfortunate,
but you'll have to accept it.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,926
When it comes to you
and the heretics you executed...

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,055
neither of you will be known to history.

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:17,934
Do you understand?

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,978
So, in the future,

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,690
even if a book that proposes
something like heliocentrism is published,

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,276
don't make a fuss.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,610
It's pointless.

9
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,989
Antoni...

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,784
I may be ignorant,
but I know what this is.

11
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,914
You speak of faith,
but what you care about is money.

12
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,046
You've always been that way.

13
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,175
And you're the one who tempted him.

14
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,430
The end must be near
when even clergy are for sale.

15
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,307
How much did you offer?

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,142
Well...

17
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,479
I don't have
a particular cause to advocate.

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,273
We're all moving
toward the same destination.

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,692
I'm just trying to get there first.

20
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,863
To the coming age... of money.

21
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,200
Money.

22
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,286
You'd throw away God for that?

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,457
As long as it earns money, anything goes.

24
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,211
Do you really welcome such an age?

25
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,341
We witnessed the leader
of the Heretic Liberation Front

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,718
blow herself up with explosives.

27
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,346
Could you really watch that

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,849
and not find it tragic?

29
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,939
That explosion is where
knowledge and technology lead.

30
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,275
Acts done in the name
of civilization or reason

31
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,114
could massacre far more
than those done in the name of God.

32
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,782
Can't you see?

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,995
Where will we go when God no longer
provides us with the correct path?

34
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,748
If we lose God,

35
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,000
humankind can only wander.

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,670
Yes.

37
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,673
But...

38
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,342
"Surely, morality is something
you find when you're lost."

39
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,138
The leader spoke those words.

40
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,517
Even I don't think peace
is on the horizon.

41
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
Just as you said,

42
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,522
the next age may see scores of people die.

43
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,359
But the responsibility
for those deaths is not God's.

44
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,527
It's humanity's.

45
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,406
Sin and salvation will be replaced

46
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,075
by self-reflection and self-reliance.

47
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,873
The wisdom we gain from suffering

48
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,792
will one day enable us to wander.

49
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,212
{\an8}We can pull
reckless civilization to a halt

50
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,923
{\an8}and tame abnormal technology.

51
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,928
Your optimism is pathetic.

52
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,680
Yes.

53
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,348
But even so,

54
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,810
I remember what the mentor
who betrayed me once said.

55
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,814
"Think for yourself
in a world with no God."

56
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,152
I want to believe
that will open a path forward.

57
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,533
Plus, you're forgetting
the most important thing of all.

58
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,827
Surely...

59
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,792
Even if God disappears from society,

60
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,879
God can't be erased from humans' souls.

61
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,176
You're as childish as you look.

62
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,763
Careless, headstrong, and selfish.

63
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,183
A child not worth talking to.

64
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,684
Is that so?

65
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,270
In that case, we're done talking.

66
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,940
You did your duty.

67
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,901
But it is out of step with the times.

68
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,321
The winds have already shifted.

69
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,827
You have served well. Be at rest.

70
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,332
I doubt we'll meet again.

71
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,085
If you have any final words, I'll listen.

72
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,881
I don't want to believe it.

73
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,216
Huh?

74
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,885
To think I was right

75
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,845
to plan for the worst...

76
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,349
"Plan for the worst"?

77
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,855
What's going on? I smell alcohol.

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,233
You noticed?

79
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,278
I poured several bottles' worth outside.

80
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,240
I also soaked straw with it
and left it out there.

81
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,366
Huh?

82
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:44,867
What?!

83
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,871
You may be right
that the winds have shifted.

84
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,665
But what will happen

85
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,627
if we all die here tonight?

86
00:04:55,295 --> 00:05:01,009
And what if this whole church
is burned by someone's hand?

87
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:06,514
And what if I left the following message
with the gatekeepers?

88
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,435
"I'm going to the church
to investigate a heretic."

89
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,646
"The suspect is a believer
in heliocentrism."

90
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,775
If that happens,

91
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,611
who will the citizens blame?

92
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,071
Huh?

93
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,493
Humans misunderstand, don't they?

94
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,245
They jump to conclusions.

95
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,830
Well?

96
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,167
Have the winds shifted again?

97
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,510
W-What have you done?

98
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,766
I had a bad feeling when I heard
a woman had gone to the church.

99
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:56,356
What would I do if heliocentrism
were somehow judged acceptable?

100
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:03,279
But even I didn't expect
to witness such a total reversal.

101
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,408
I'm glad I had a backup plan.

102
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:13,539
Now rumors will spread that
believers of heliocentrism are dangerous.

103
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,168
Do you really think your plan will work?

104
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,421
I'll never know if I don't try.

105
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,008
Are you going to kill me too?

106
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,015
To be honest, I don't care either way.

107
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,686
Even if you escape
and tell people the truth,

108
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,106
I doubt anyone will believe you.

109
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,150
But then again,

110
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,780
it would be safer to kill you here.

111
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,096
Hi there.

112
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,747
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

113
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:30,528
{\an8}EPISODE 23
COMRADES

114
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,654
Lord God,

115
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,909
is this some kind of revelation?

116
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,244
No.

117
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,206
Surely, I'm just an illusion

118
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,792
that your dying mind has conjured.

119
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,296
Oh, is that how it goes?

120
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,173
Yes, that's how it goes.

121
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,553
Anyway, long time no see.

122
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,097
How have things been since that day?

123
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,059
Awful.

124
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,186
Thanks to you.

125
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm not the only one.

126
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:11,068
A whole slew of lives were ruined
by you and your stone chest.

127
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,321
That's a bit harsh.

128
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,199
I had a bright future
snuffed out by that too.

129
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,119
Right... I guess that's true.

130
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,165
But it was quite a joke in the end.

131
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,795
They say heliocentrism
isn't even blasphemy.

132
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,883
How could you not laugh?

133
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,053
Oh, that's right.

134
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,806
I kept this.

135
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,767
You can have it back.

136
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,311
I don't need it anymore.

137
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,189
No, it's fine.

138
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,191
Why?

139
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,235
I'm an illusion, so I can't receive it.

140
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,695
And besides,

141
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,199
it no longer belongs to me alone.

142
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,786
I see.

143
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,955
Damn it...

144
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,542
Who'd have thought
it would turn out like this?

145
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,878
What have I...

146
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,923
What have I done with my life?

147
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,927
It is what it is.

148
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,555
We each did what we could
under the circumstances.

149
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,057
Both of us.

150
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,601
You're wrong.

151
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,438
There's a big difference
between you and me.

152
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,315
We played different roles.

153
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,029
When I heard heliocentrism
isn't blasphemy, I finally realized it.

154
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,701
Something that had never
occurred to me before.

155
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,495
I'm...

156
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,668
I'm the villain of this story.

157
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,384
Damn it. How could I not see it?

158
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,303
Yes.

159
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,933
It's true that we were on opposing sides.

160
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,104
The world is full of all types of people.

161
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,065
Some are honest, and some are liars.

162
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,985
Some are pitiful, and some are brave.

163
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,904
And perhaps most surprising of all,

164
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:23,117
a single person can contain
all of those qualities within them.

165
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,995
They might change from day to day.

166
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,998
There are so many of us,

167
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,666
and yet no two are the same.

168
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,462
It's no wonder we never stop fighting.

169
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,215
But... despite that,

170
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:43,512
when the people of the past or future
gaze across the span of time,

171
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,726
they'll merely see us all
as people from the fifteenth century.

172
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,605
We found ourselves in this day and age,

173
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,691
though we may have been
better off in another.

174
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,361
That is a mere coincidence.

175
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,864
But it is also miraculous

176
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,365
and destined to be.

177
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,827
More than those born
with similar philosophies,

178
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,790
I feel much closer to those
who were born in the same era as me.

179
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,919
Though it may seem absurd,

180
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,048
and thought and feeling may deny it,
I'd like to believe this.

181
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,302
I feel that we,
who happened to live in this day and age,

182
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,055
<i>even if we hated one another
enough to kill,</i>

183
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,308
<i>are comrades who built an era together.</i>

184
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,440
"Comrades who built an era together"?

185
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,110
Are you trying

186
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,238
to reassure me?

187
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,282
Of course!

188
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,869
After all, I'm just an illusion
that you created.

189
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,414
Thanks.

190
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,043
But I can't accept your generosity.

191
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,337
After all,

192
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,341
I felt something toward you.

193
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:09,265
{\an8}A feeling that I should never hold
for a heretic like yourself.

194
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,352
I pretended to forget it
and carried on with my life.

195
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,563
What was it?

196
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,568
Pain.

197
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,906
I felt pity seeing the choice you made.

198
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,993
"You mustn't choose death."

199
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:34,456
"You're too young to be killed by beliefs,
be they your own or those of others."

200
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,208
That's what I thought.

201
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,878
{\an8}Is that so?

202
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,755
{\an8}We do think differently then.

203
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,509
But I'll keep that in mind.

204
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,766
That may have been

205
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,520
the first and final chance God gave me.

206
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,858
But the feelings were a nuisance,
and I ignored them.

207
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,737
And so, it's beyond doubt.

208
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,781
I'm the villain.

209
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,959
Do you have anything else to say?

210
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,463
This building will probably collapse soon.

211
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,006
You'll die too.

212
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,428
You know things, right?

213
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,347
Then tell me.

214
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,766
It's my final request.

215
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,811
Did my daughter

216
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,564
make it to heaven?

217
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,651
Who knows?

218
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,278
I told you back then.

219
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,906
No one knows what happens after death.

220
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,077
Still, if you want that for her,

221
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,621
while you're still alive,

222
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,457
please do what's appropriate.

223
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,043
Finish what you started.

224
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,922
Now then, farewell.

225
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,710
<i>Now I see.</i>

226
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,504
<i>You found something too.</i>

227
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,465
Something worth

228
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,635
the risk of descending to hell.

229
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,475
Lord God...

230
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,979
{\an8}Lord God...

231
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,940
My daughter's sins

232
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,776
all stemmed from my misunderstanding.

233
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,779
They're all my sins.

234
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,285
If heliocentrism does not defy your will...

235
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,914
Please...

236
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,417
Please.

237
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,882
Please accept her into heaven.

238
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,474
Into... heaven...

239
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,159
Damn it all.

240
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,619
That bastard...

241
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,538
He didn't have to stab me.

242
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,065
I'm... gonna die.

243
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,901
Damn it.

244
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,365
I was wrong.

245
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,035
When I die, it all ends.

246
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,788
No God, no afterlife.

247
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,665
The money I earned,

248
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,127
the knowledge I gained,
and even the future I foresaw.

249
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,670
They were all a waste.

250
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,131
It ends for me

251
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,717
in a place like this.

252
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,430
What was my life...

253
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,432
even worth?

254
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,288
{\an8}1468, URBAN DISTRICT
IN THE KINGDOM OF POLAND

255
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,957
Okay, everyone!

256
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,959
Please get in line!

257
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:57,172
This is my first time here,
but it's as popular as they say.

258
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,590
Why, thank you.

259
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,093
May I take your order?

260
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,929
Oh, are you his son?

261
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,975
Uh, no. I'm just someone in his care.

262
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,978
Oh? Where are you from then?

263
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,106
Um...

264
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,696
Sorry to keep you waiting!

265
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,489
The bread is ready!

266
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,825
Come and get it!

267
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,080
You worked hard again today.

268
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,499
You too, sir.

269
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,462
That reminds me, Albert.

270
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,090
I have something to tell you.

271
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,008
Do you mind?

272
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,429
I'll cut to the chase.

273
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,016
You can go to university!

274
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,268
Huh?

275
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,521
Surprised, eh?

276
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,774
But don't worry. Just listen!

277
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:03,530
As you know, we bakers
must sell bread at a price and weight

278
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,034
proportionate to the cost
of the wheat bought by the authorities.

279
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,578
<i>You're a clever boy.</i>

280
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,623
<i>You can anticipate market changes
and make estimates.</i>

281
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,587
<i>Your numbers help me make
just enough bread at the perfect ratio.</i>

282
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,173
Thanks to you, my shop is a great success!

283
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,717
You've distinguished yourself!

284
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,387
And that's why

285
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,848
I'm happy to pay your entire tuition!

286
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,391
Thank you very much.

287
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,143
However, I decline.

288
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,478
Huh?

289
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,813
Did I ever say

290
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,107
that I wanted to attend university?

291
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,818
Well, you're smart,

292
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,404
and you used to love to learn.

293
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,740
I have no use for academia.

294
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,116
It's meaningless.

295
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,119
No, worse. It's evil.

296
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,538
Curiosity swallows humans.

297
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,251
Research will always
turn into ambition and run amok.

298
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,838
It's best to avoid it.

299
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,174
It's true

300
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,677
that I don't understand
what you went through long ago.

301
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,971
I should have been more considerate.

302
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,141
Well, I appreciate the offer,

303
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,769
but I'd prefer to forget the past.

304
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,523
As long as I can make a living,
I'm satisfied.

305
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,234
I don't want anything else.

306
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,152
Wait a second!

307
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,866
If that's the case, why haven't you
thrown away your astrolabe?

308
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,957
