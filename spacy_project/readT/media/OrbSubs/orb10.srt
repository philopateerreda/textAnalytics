{\an8}EPISODE TEN
TRUTH

3
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,356
I'm coming in.

4
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,899
Badeni?

5
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,197
I know it's sudden,
but I need this barn for my research.

6
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,533
I don't want to work at the church.

7
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,286
For the time being,
I'll need you to use another--

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,204
Huh?

9
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,790
What is that?

10
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,167
Oh, uh...

11
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,839
I've been learning to read and write.
Jolenta taught me.

12
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,798
What?

13
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,717
Unbelievable...

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,845
How could Jolenta do such a thing?

15
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,682
Teaching the written word
to someone of your class?

16
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,599
Huh?

17
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,853
You don't get it.

18
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:29,190
It's a good thing
that most people can't read or write.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,570
Reading and writing are special skills.

20
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,531
To leave words behind
is a heavy responsibility.

21
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,827
It requires certain natural gifts
and a minimum level of education.

22
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,913
If the written word
were available to everyone,

23
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,332
unreliable information
would flood the world.

24
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,377
It would be a dire situation indeed.

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,546
Th-That's...

26
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,175
Besides, what use do you have
for reading and writing?

27
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,802
Well, I...

28
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,556
I'm thinking of writing a book.

29
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,057
What?

30
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,103
Of course, I have no intention or means
of making it public.

31
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,606
It's more like a diary.

32
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,816
I won't reveal my name.

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,026
Huh?

34
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,654
I sort of want to write about
the work we've done so far.

35
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,864
What?

36
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,825
But of course,
I can't write anything technical.

37
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,036
It would be more like a story.

38
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,663
H-Hold on a second.

39
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,709
There's a lot I want to say.

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,502
But first off,

41
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,880
why would you do that?

42
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,089
What?

43
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,469
Why would someone like you,
who could never read or write,

44
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:44,974
want to write about these past few months
and risk putting someone on our trail?

45
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,017
And why now?

46
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,854
That's, uh...

47
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,149
Never mind.

48
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,527
You won't be able to write much anyway.

49
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,198
And even if you manage to,
I'll burn the pages, so do as you please.

50
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,993
I might lose my mind
if we continue this conversation.

51
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,371
Could you please leave?

52
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,873
Forgive me.

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,126
Father Grabowski!

54
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,295
Why do rainbows occur?

55
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,007
They are God's way of congratulating us

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,635
for withstanding the rain.

57
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,303
- Wow!
- Wow!

58
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:26,307
So then, why do rainbows
have so many colors?

59
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,519
Oh, uh... that's...

60
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,688
Well...

61
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,319
Excuse me, Badeni.

62
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,407
Huh? Badeni?!

63
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,038
Oh, sorry.

64
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,832
I haven't been sleeping much.

65
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,376
A-Are you okay?

66
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,585
Yes.

67
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,089
Um, sorry to disturb your rest, but...

68
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,802
Do you know why rainbows
produce so many colors?

69
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,305
The children asked me just now,

70
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,931
but I couldn't answer.

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,600
You expect me to tell you for free?

72
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,270
Oh, uh... very well.

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,273
I'll arrange for extra ink and paper.

74
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,775
That'll do.

75
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,944
According to Epicurus,

76
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:24,949
rainbows occur when sunlight
passes through a moist atmosphere.

77
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,244
Furthermore, the colors
are produced, in part or in whole,

78
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,790
by a special bond that occurs
between the light and the atmosphere.

79
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:39,714
The resulting light is reflected
and absorbed again by the atmosphere,

80
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,842
leading to the final array of colors.

81
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,926
That sums it up.

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,805
Thank you very much.

83
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,313
So, how do I explain that to the children?

84
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,356
I have no idea.

85
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,567
Are we done yet?

86
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,652
Badeni,

87
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,572
have you read Epicurus's work?

88
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,325
Yes, I had reason to do so recently.

89
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,745
Of course, I only did it
to refute his pagan ideas,

90
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,874
so don't bother telling me that
his atomic theory is atheistic in nature.

91
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,044
In that case, have you read
Lucretius's work too?

92
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,088
The poet who praised Epicurus.

93
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,006
Well, yes.

94
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,341
Really?

95
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,343
To be honest,

96
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,263
I joined the monastery in part
because I wanted to read his work.

97
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,308
I never got the chance though.

98
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,310
But of course,

99
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,397
my interest stems
from a desire to help the Church.

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,107
I see.

101
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,359
Why Lucretius, though?

102
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,445
Because so many learned men quote him.

103
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,157
It's said that Lucretius's poems are

104
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,826
inspiring.

105
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,579
Oh, but since it was written by a pagan,

106
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,831
I'm wary of course.

107
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,000
If you've read his works,

108
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,212
I'd be grateful
if you could share even a portion--

109
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,588
I'm afraid I refuse.

110
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,634
You should know

111
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,680
that I have no interest
in the sharing of knowledge.

112
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,473
In fact, I despise it.

113
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,310
When commoners seek knowledge,
it only leads to tragedy.

114
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:22,442
Furthermore, an ordinary person
without the proper qualifications

115
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,652
has no need for it.

116
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,071
But that's...

117
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,239
Excuse me then.

118
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,620
I can't take it anymore.

119
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,081
Badeni's attitude is intolerable.

120
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,209
How can a disciple of the Church
be so arrogant?

121
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,504
<i>Ordinary people without qualifications?</i>

122
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,131
<i>He's far too prejudiced.</i>

123
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,592
<i>Every individual has a purpose!</i>

124
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,432
<i>Wait, but if I look at it that way,</i>

125
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,517
<i>Badeni has his purpose too.</i>

126
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,103
<i>I may disapprove,</i>

127
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,397
<i>but I can't be wrathful toward a neighbor.</i>

128
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,317
<i>I have much to learn as a believer too.</i>

129
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,360
<i>Remember!</i>

130
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,154
<i>My role</i>

131
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,448
<i>is to aid the villagers in their faith.</i>

132
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,575
<i>Focus only on that.</i>

133
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,203
{\an8}<i>That's right.</i>

134
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,704
{\an8}<i>Why would I need knowledge</i>

135
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,500
{\an8}<i>of a pagan like Lucretius now?</i>

136
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,127
<i>Why should I want to...</i>

137
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,630
Father Grabowski!

138
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,842
Oh, forgive me. I must have drifted off.

139
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,721
That's only because
you work so hard for us.

140
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,265
That reminds me.

141
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,850
Do you all want to hear

142
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,354
the story of how Badeni
got that scar on his face?

143
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:45,441
Oh! I've been wondering
about that scar for a while.

144
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,443
Please tell us!

145
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,362
That's what I thought.

146
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,241
<i>Before Badeni took the cloth,</i>

147
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,786
<i>he attended a certain private school.</i>

148
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,579
<i>His close friend also attended,</i>

149
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,166
<i>with whom he performed joint research</i>

150
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,585
<i>and shared information.</i>

151
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:09,382
{\an8}So, even Badeni has friends, huh?

152
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,217
{\an8}But one day,

153
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,471
{\an8}that friend stole credit
for Badeni's research.

154
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,975
That's not the surprising part though.

155
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,644
When Badeni confronted him,

156
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:26,232
his friend was enraged
and challenged him to a duel!

157
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,234
You don't mean--

158
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,487
That's right. Badeni is alive.

159
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,032
<i>That means the duel ended</i>

160
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,744
<i>with Badeni killing his close friend.</i>

161
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,832
<i>The scar he has now
is the result of that fight.</i>

162
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,293
How awful!

163
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,545
Where did you hear such a story?

164
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,714
From Badeni himself.

165
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,633
I asked him about the scar,
and he told me.

166
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,095
{\an8}Wait, you mean a killer
became a clergyman?

167
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,223
{\an8}If the duel happened
before the candidate joined the clergy,

168
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,394
{\an8}the Church will overlook it
if they have a logical reason to join.

169
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,731
{\an8}In either case, it's a frightening story.

170
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:07,690
{\an8}Yes.

171
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,193
{\an8}Please make sure Badeni
keeps to himself, as he does now.

172
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,045
Excuse me.

173
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,047
Huh?

174
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,300
I'm sorry for prying,

175
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,553
but I heard the story about your scar.

176
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,182
That must have been painful.

177
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,976
I suppose. We were close after all.

178
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,020
So, why?

179
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,438
Huh?

180
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,191
{\an8}Why, after experiencing such tragedy,

181
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,069
{\an8}do you still engage

182
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,404
{\an8}in research or scholarship?

183
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,575
Because I don't want to discard

184
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,328
the potential that God provides us.

185
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,374
Thanks to that,

186
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,169
I could even be present
at a moment of historical significance.

187
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,672
Even so,

188
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,341
your uncontrollable curiosity

189
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,178
and unnecessary thirst for knowledge
are without limit.

190
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,014
One day that will become its own purpose

191
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,975
and lead you to immoral behavior.

192
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,980
Isn't the world already full
of immoral behavior?

193
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,568
Grabowski,

194
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,071
what do you think is necessary

195
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,573
to change such a world?

196
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,242
Huh?

197
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,412
Truth.

198
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,040
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

199
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:48,958
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

200
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,048
Truth, huh?

201
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,345
And that's why it should only be handled
by those who are qualified to do so.

202
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:06,058
Then again, I'm not interested
in doing things for the world's sake.

203
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,356
Hello there, Father Grabowski!

204
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,359
How rare to see you outside the church.

205
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,612
Well, I thought I'd visit
the library in town.

206
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,073
The library? Are you needed there?

207
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,075
It's nothing like that.

208
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,288
I just thought I'd learn something
outside my duties for once.

209
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,708
What?!

210
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,711
It's closed today, of all days?

211
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,046
But why?

212
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,424
Well,

213
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,594
I'm not sorry I came.

214
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,847
Yes, think of it like that.

215
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,850
Huh?

216
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,283
There are still discrepancies
with the contents of the stone chest.

217
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,118
But why?

218
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,537
Why aren't the orbits perfect circles?

219
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,547
Oczy!

220
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,467
Here's your daily bread.

221
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,885
Oh, thank you!

222
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,056
By the way,

223
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,265
have you heard?

224
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,433
Huh?

225
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,728
Count Piast has gone to heaven.

226
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,105
I see.

227
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,358
We'd better pray for him then.

228
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,651
Yes.

229
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,154
Anyway, it seems
they're restructuring the organization,

230
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,739
so Jolenta's busy too.

231
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,782
I can imagine.

232
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,328
It seems she was destined
to pull away from our research.

233
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,541
Putting that aside, I have a request.

234
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,293
Can you start digging a tunnel tomorrow?

235
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,461
Huh?

236
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,630
One from the barn to the church.

237
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,384
We'll need an escape path too,
just in case.

238
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,845
Oh, uh... right.

239
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,223
I'll get back to work then.

240
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,808
Excuse me!

241
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,729
In return for doing that work,

242
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,607
I also have a request.

243
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,984
Oh?

244
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,945
You're negotiating with me
when I'm in a bad mood

245
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,488
after research has stalled?

246
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,698
That's shrewd of you.

247
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,699
Uh...

248
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,118
Never mind. What is it?

249
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,080
Could you increase my bread rations?

250
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,500
I, uh...

251
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,378
You want more for the beggars, don't you?

252
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,214
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

253
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,800
You've been handing them out in secret.

254
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,553
As I told you before, it's a waste.

255
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,097
It won't bring you closer to heaven.

256
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,352
Well, I won't tell you to stop,

257
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,770
but no bread increases.

258
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,356
Rations are fixed.

259
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,997
It's still wrong.

260
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,499
The calculations contain errors.

261
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,085
They don't match Count Piast's records.

262
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,962
Why?

263
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,173
The theory itself is flawless.

264
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,551
With the Sun at the center,
planetary orbits must be perfect circles

265
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,346
with no retrograde movement.

266
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,976
{\an8}Wait, even a man like Count Piast
was still human.

267
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,896
{\an8}The records may be imperfect.

268
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,193
After all, he assumed
that the geocentric model was true.

269
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,780
That bias may have impacted his accuracy.

270
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,326
The problem isn't the theory

271
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,994
but the records?

272
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,207
What is this necklace?

273
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,043
{\an8}Is it Oczy's?

274
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,679
{\an8}Even with two centers,
one can draw a circle.

275
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,264
{\an8}In doing so, the orbit would be...

276
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,102
{\an8}elliptical?

277
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,064
Thanks to the stone chest,
I know the orbital period of Mars.

278
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,734
If I apply that and draw lines
from the fixed stars to the Sun and Mars,

279
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,196
I could use the point of intersection
to calculate Earth's position.

280
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,200
Based on that, if I pick a date
when Mars was observed from Earth

281
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,746
and compare it to observations
of Mars 1.88 years later,

282
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,207
the orbit of Mars would be...

283
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:00,978
Yes.

284
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,606
Yes!

285
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,194
Yes!

286
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,953
Dear Lord... I may have it.

287
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,878
If I continue with this method,

288
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,963
perform precise calculations,

289
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,882
and create a polished treatise...

290
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,008
Huh?

291
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,977
Is this the book that Oczy was working on?

292
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,062
How strange.

293
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,607
He gives charity, despite not being rich,

294
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,443
and he writes, despite not being educated.

295
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,821
I really don't understand peasants.

296
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,431
There's a large man with his hair tied
who gives you bread, right?

297
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,184
{\an8}Uh... yes.

298
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,605
I promise that he will continue to do so.

299
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,982
But in return,

300
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,735
there's something I want from you.

301
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,572
I don't have anything.

302
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,741
No.

303
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,078
What I want is up here.

304
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,498
Where is that?

305
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:50,963
Your rations.

306
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,509
Huh? There's more than usual.

307
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,804
I remembered I don't eat much.

308
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,640
Keep working hard on the tunnel.

309
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,092
How rare.

310
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,261
You're usually in the barn at this hour.

311
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,305
What about research?

312
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:46,185
Oczy, you can have that barn back now.

313
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,645
Huh?

314
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,316
It's done.

315
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,651
What?

316
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,413
The heliocentric theory is complete.

317
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,052
We finally begin work.

318
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,639
Yeah. To tell the truth, I'm nervous.

319
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,766
Well, let's just do our best.

320
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,935
The Bishop has arrived.

321
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,158
Good afternoon, my dear brothers.

322
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,037
As you all know, from this day on,

323
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,873
you will serve as inquisitors.

324
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,795
Before you begin,
there's something I'd like to say.

325
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,548
It concerns the importance
of your position.

326
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,093
Several hundred years ago,

327
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,681
the fall of Western Rome
plunged the world into disorder.

328
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,642
Chaos and violence ruled,

329
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,936
authority was gained and lost,

330
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,815
and there was nothing to unite
a divided humankind.

331
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,736
People of all types
lost what was dear to them.

332
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,531
In the midst of that turmoil,

333
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,825
the one ray of hope

334
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,412
came from us, the Church.

335
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,958
We spread culture and morality
throughout society,

336
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,128
and brought love and salvation
to everyday life.

337
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,922
The Church binds the people together.

338
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:45,012
You might think that no one could complain
about such wonderful efforts.

339
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,016
But surprisingly, some do.

340
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,977
They are none other
than the pagans and heretics.

341
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:56,440
Having lost their faith,
they only find meaning in destruction.

342
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,942
They speak misguidedly of freedom,

343
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,236
break down morality and ethics,

344
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,739
abandon salvation and hope,

345
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,741
and pull the people apart.

346
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,702
All of us, together...

347
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,290
must save the heretics.

348
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:18,378
They are victims
who have been led astray by the Devil.

349
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,548
When their lives end,
their souls will descend to hell.

350
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,551
Nothing could be worse.

351
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,553
Through your work,

352
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,223
I hope you will guide
the heretics in the right direction.

353
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:35,979
Those of us alive today have never seen
the world in its former state of madness.

354
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,065
But that is exactly why

355
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:42,069
we cannot let such an age
fall upon us again.

356
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,488
That is our responsibility.

357
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:49,326
For our families,
the future, and the faithful.

358
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,912
And for the heretics as well.

359
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,831
You are needed.

360
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,125
Through your work,

361
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,794
through your passion,

362
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,254

00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,798
I'm counting on you.

364
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,595
I think I was taking this job too lightly.

365
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,930
Gotta pull it together.

366
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,765
Yeah, me too.

367
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,768
This is no time for petty complaints.

368
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,894
Yeah.

369
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,022
Let's put our hearts and souls into it.

Hey, you two.

371
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,985
Hi there.
