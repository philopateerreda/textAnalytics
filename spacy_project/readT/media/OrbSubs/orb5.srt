{\an8}EPISODE FIVE
EVEN IF I DIE... THIS WORLD WILL CONTINUE

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,514
Come on, Damian.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,350
Did you really need me for this?

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,354
This heretic was assigned to Peter.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,858
You can't just loan him to me
for transfer duty.

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:26,985
Nowak.

7
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,612
For a long time, I've been wondering

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,614
about your poor attitude.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,532
Huh?

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,868
Our work is to serve God

11
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,996
by defending the sanctity of faith.

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,248
Complacency is inexcusable.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,916
Don't you realize

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,794
that you'll be responsible
if something happens?

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,298
Um, wait. I didn't mean...

16
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,476
What? Hey!

17
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,978
What's going on?

18
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,605
What is it?

19
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,981
The wagon in front.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,816
I saw the driver jump off, and now...

21
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,360
What the...

22
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,862
It's those watchmen.

23
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,197
They've betrayed us.

24
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,908
Stop here.

25
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,624
H-Hey, is that permitted?

26
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,626
This is an emergency.

27
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,503
One shot should be fine.

28
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,611
Oh, man.

29
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,155
What a crash.

30
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,573
It can't be saved now.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,912
P-Please help me!

32
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,247
Huh?

33
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,091
Wait!

34
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,135
I was being threatened!

35
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,428
You expect me to believe that?

36
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,348
Well...

37
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,858
<i>He's fully focused.</i>

38
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,947
<i>This guy is tough.</i>

39
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,533
<i>I'd probably die fighting him.</i>

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,452
<i>That leaves only one option.</i>

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,998
I surrender!

42
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,083
I was wrong! Please have mercy!

43
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,294
Huh?

44
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,254
Seriously?

45
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,463
But that's...

46
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:56,801
What were the rules
for voluntary surrender again?

47
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,429
Let's see.

48
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,307
"Exercise your own judgment"?

49
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,101
That's the biggest pain of all.

50
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,938
Well, you already double-crossed us once.

51
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,274
Would they allow this?

52
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,860
You're of no use to me anyway.

53
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,777
Huh?

54
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,243
What?

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,161
Why?

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,916
Because history needs you.

57
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,167
Take this.

58
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,153
- Nowak!
- Huh?

59
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,197
Should I bring your crossbow?

60
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,408
No, don't bother.

61
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,661
What? But why?

62
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,287
It's not worth...

63
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,751
Um, I'd only get in trouble
for using more arrows.

64
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,921
Plus, the thing we need to secure

65
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,924
is lying right here.

66
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,347
As a former soldier myself,
I know it all too well.

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,225
Those two can't read a word.

68
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,978
They don't have the brains for heresy.

69
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,649
There's no use going after them.

70
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,759
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

71
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,511
Um...

72
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,765
I won't run, so you can lower your sword.

73
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,975
Oh, right.

74
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm sorry I got you mixed up in this.

75
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,904
Even so, I'm not looking for a do-over.

76
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,365
Given another chance,

77
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,409
I'd probably make the same choice.

78
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,911
So my apology is a bit insincere.

79
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,581
{\an8}I apologize for that too.

80
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,169
Oh, uh... I understand.

81
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,144
This looks like a clearing.

82
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,105
We might be near the middle of the slope.

83
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,523
Let's look around.

84
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:39,917
Gras!

85
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,384
{\an8}I-Is this it?

86
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,409
What is... this diagram?

87
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,163
These seem like letters.

88
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,539
There are two.

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,334
One is dated recently, and the other

90
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,711
is from ten years ago.

91
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,465
Can I see the recent one?

92
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,258
It might be from the heretic.

93
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,516
Damn it, my eye...

94
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,684
Let's see.

95
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,521
First, let me state

96
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,483
that I did not create
the contents of this stone chest.

97
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,318
I discovered them.

98
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:52,990
Therefore, I will record
the story of that discovery.

99
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,244
<i>As an astrologer,</i>

100
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,038
<i>I made a daily habit
of observing the heavens.</i>

101
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,625
<i>One day, while seeking
greater elevation and visibility,</i>

102
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,753
<i>I discovered a spot
that was perfect for observation.</i>

103
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,839
<i>Then I noticed something curious.</i>

104
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,635
<i>Carved into each
of the two nearby rock formations</i>

105
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,638
<i>were three stars
with a mark in the center.</i>

106
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,808
<i>It resembled Orion's Belt.</i>

107
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,270
<i>As if corresponding to the middle star,</i>

108
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,397
<i>the space between the rocks</i>

109
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,525
<i>was in line with the middle
of the mountain on the opposite side.</i>

110
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,194
<i>What could possibly be there?</i>

111
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,530
<i>Who had done this and why?</i>

112
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,034
<i>Spurred by curiosity,
I made my way to the mountain.</i>

113
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,039
<i>And finally, I encountered this chest.</i>

114
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:48,254
"In the end, I never learned
who left the chest behind

115
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,548
or why they had done so."

116
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,968
"But though the contents
of the chest were incomplete,

117
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:58,431
it was clear to me that they could change
the history and fate of humankind."

118
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,310
"Even if I were to die
because of the contents of this chest,

119
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,939
I can say my life was fortunate
for having discovered them."

120
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,073
"For further details, I ask that
you confirm the materials herein."

121
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,745
"Selfishly, I too
have adjusted multiple calculations."

122
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,747
"That is all."

123
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,125
What does the other letter say?

124
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,084
Huh?

125
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,131
I don't know.

126
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,175
I never learned to read.

127
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,679
Oh, but...
I think I know what the title says.

128
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,431
What's that?

129
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,309
Earth.

130
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,981
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH
CHAPTER TWO

131
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
It's no use.

132
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,364
This bridge is broken too.

133
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,740
We'll have to go around.

134
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,867
From where we are...

135
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,708
<i>I forgot about this thing.</i>

136
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,506
You're throwing it away?

137
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,632
Yes.

138
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,967
It belonged to the heretic, after all.

139
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,012
Still, it's an important clue.

140
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,889
I'll take it.

141
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,561
Now, let's go.

142
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,068
Earth?

143
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,737
Yes. That's what the envelope says.

144
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,948
Hand it to me. I'll read it.

145
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,076
Let's see.

146
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,079
"I offer you the secrets
of the starry sky."

147
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,999
"If any profit should be earned
from this endeavor,

148
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,503
ten percent should be given to Potocki."

149
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,256
"His support has been valuable."

150
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,757
"His address is..."

151
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,551
Well,

152
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,845
this doesn't tell us anything either.

153
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,056
What the heck is in here?

154
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,352
As far as these documents go,

155
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,771
I'd guess they're related to astronomy.

156
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,232
However, I can't read Latin

157
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,776
or understand the figures.

158
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,821
As far as our future is concerned,

159
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,115
because of my actions,

160
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,743
you won't be welcome
in town or at the guild.

161
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,079
But if I may justify myself,

162
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,832
the circumstances we're in

163
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,751
can be turned to our advantage.

164
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,587
Judging by the volume,

165
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,006
these materials weren't made on a whim.

166
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,592
They're something significant.

167
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,553
Show them to the right person,

168
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,388
and the reward could be big.

169
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,767
Plus, we'd get to learn
about the contents.

170
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,686
Where will you find this "right person"?

171
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,899
I actually have someone in mind.

172
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,028
<i>The monk that told me about the planets.</i>

173
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,489
<i>I believe his name was</i>

174
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,073
<i>Badeni.</i>

175
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,619
You want to discuss heresy with a monk?!

176
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,497
He's no ordinary monk.

177
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,625
He was demoted a short time ago.

178
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,711
The reasons were unruly behavior

179
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,005
and contrarian thought.

180
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,966
Perfect, right?

181
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,677
With that settled, let's go.

182
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,641
Is something wrong?

183
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,394
My... head is spinning.

184
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:37,316
I've come this far,
but now that I have time to think,

185
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,779
I don't see why I should go with you.

186
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,409
Will you decide for me, Gras?

187
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,661
If I should go or not...

188
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,334
Two is safer than one,

189
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,670
so I'd appreciate a companion.

190
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,006
In that case, I'll go with you.

191
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,182
Oczy.

192
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,812
Could you find the North Star for me?

193
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,647
We should orient ourselves.

194
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,483
I'm afraid I injured my eye earlier.

195
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,404
Forgive me, but I can't do that.

196
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,114
Huh?

197
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,991
But with your vision...

198
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,743
I... can't look at the sky.

199
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,661
I, uh...

200
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,914
I'm afraid.

201
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,501
<i>A priest told me something once.</i>

202
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,753
<i>The night sky is beautiful</i>

203
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,632
<i>because we gaze at it
from the lowly Earth.</i>

204
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,137
Since then, when I look at the sky,

205
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,474
the stars appear to me like eyes
looking down on humankind.

206
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,811
I know that sounds strange.

207
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,024
Before that, could you look at the stars?

208
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,109
Y-Yes.

209
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,986
Actually...

210
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,032
I think I enjoyed it.

211
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,495
{\an8}You've never had the urge
to see the stars again?

212
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,750
{\an8}No. It's too scary.

213
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,544
But if it was something you enjoyed,

214
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,713
it's a shame to give it up, right?

215
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,548
I guess so...

216
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,762
Then again, it doesn't concern you, Gras.

217
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,473
Of course not.

218
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,268
But I lost my family in the past,

219
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,521
so I know what it's like
to lose the things you love.

220
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,527
Compared to that, my problem is minor.

221
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,489
After all, I'm still alive.

222
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,200
That's not true.

223
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,411
For you, it's a major problem.

224
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,288
Oh, but...

225
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,918
In your case,
I'm sure they were never lost.

226
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,214
Your family is surely in heaven now.

227
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,092
You'll reunite with them there.

228
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,888
Thank you. I believe so too.

229
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,057
However,

230
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,351
what I really lost

231
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,270
was my hope for this world.

232
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,316
Until recently,

233
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,237
I did nothing but curse this world
that stole my family.

234
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,823
But when I thought deeper,

235
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,534
this world was where I met my family too.

236
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,286
{\an8}And if that's the case,

237
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,498
{\an8}I don't want to deny
the world that gave them to me.

238
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,251
It may be difficult,

239
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,671
but I want to view
the world positively once more.

240
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,341
This may sound cruel,

241
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,301
but I don't think that's possible.

242
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,931
Heaven is our only hope.

243
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,975
This world is corrupt.

244
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,518
It's that way

245
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,438
because that was God's will.

246
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,191
The great figures in history
have told us that.

247
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,694
Have you...

248
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,491
Have you completely given up on our world?

249
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,413
Yes.

250
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,874
Only loss awaits us here.

251
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,211
We're all going to die anyway
and end up in heaven or hell.

252
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,756
So that should be our bigger concern.

253
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,518
<i>"Heaven is our only hope"?</i>

254
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,730
<i>So then, why did that heretic</i>

255
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,567
<i>risk his life and his place in paradise</i>

256
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,027
<i>to honor our world?</i>

257
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,322
<i>Humans die.</i>

258
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,784
<i>What would be the point
in loving this world</i>

259
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,368
<i>that we will eventually leave?</i>

260
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,873
<i>When we die, all that remains
is a world without us.</i>

261
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,959
<i>How could there be hope in that?</i>

262
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,302
<i>Wait.</i>

263
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,306
<i>Could that be it?</i>

264
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,732
Oh, good. This bridge is standing.

265
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,110
The village is on the other side.

266
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,530
I guess we're safe for now.

267
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,797
- Oczy.
- Yes?

268
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,592
I've made you come with me this far.

269
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,969
So from this point,

270
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,595
I'd like you to choose.

271
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,055
What?

272
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,724
There are two paths you can take.

273
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,768
First, when we reach the village,

274
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,147
you can report what happened
and the chest we found to the Church.

275
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,859
Do that, and maybe
you can return to the village.

276
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,652
You'll get closer to heaven too.

277
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,822
But what will happen to you?

278
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,243
The second option...

279
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,339
Gras!

280
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,559
This is my...

281
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,145
I'll be brief with the second.

282
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,106
What?! This isn't the time!

283
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,691
The second option

284
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,735
is to ignore the first

285
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,612
and place your hope in this world!

286
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,529
What?

287
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,364
And then, someday,

288
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,867
turn your eyes to the stars again.

289
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,960
What are you doing?!

290
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,879
The ivy will tear!

291
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,964
D-Do you want to die?!

292
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,342
What are <i>you</i> doing?!

293
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,678
- I'm passing the torch.
- What?!

294
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,598
At this rate, we'll both die.

295
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,099
That won't do.

296
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,560
That heretic risked his life

297
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,604
because he found someone to pass it on to.

298
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,398
Just as you said,

299
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,567
this world is full of loss.

300
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,361
Furthermore,

301
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,571
we will all die and leave here someday.

302
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,408
But even if I die...
this world will continue.

303
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,536
{\an8}That means I can pass the torch.

304
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,958
{\an8}In a world that is full of loss,
that is one way

305
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,709
{\an8}that hope is born.

306
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,964
Pass it to whom?! To me?!

307
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,590
Don't expect anything from me!

308
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,717
There's no guarantee I'll do it!

309
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,261
{\an8}That's true.

310
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,221
{\an8}But you will.

311
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,015
{\an8}You aren't ready to go to heaven.

312
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,725
{\an8}Why?!

313
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,229
Because your face tells me

314
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,314
that you still fear death.

315
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,660
<i>This</i>

316
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,161
<i>is my fate.</i>

317
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,854
H-He's dead.

318
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,875
You really are kind, Grabowski.

319
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,919
You always take the time to listen to us.

320
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,131
That's because I enjoy
hearing your stories.

321
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,216
There you go again.

322
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,845
Unlike that subdeacon from before...

323
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,555
What was his name again?

324
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,266
He's nothing like you.

325
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,934
Indeed.

326
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,479
He may have been praised in the city,

327
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,314
but he's got no compassion.

328
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,525
Oh, don't say that.

329
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,445
Huh?

330
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,238
- What?
- What?

331
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,414
Excuse me.

332
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,584
You have a visitor, Badeni.

333
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,629
I'm not expecting a visitor.

334
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,882
That may be, but...

335
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,520
Who are you?

336
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,646
What do you want?

337
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,917
