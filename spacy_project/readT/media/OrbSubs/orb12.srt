1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,629
The truth is

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,298
I'm an inquisitor.

3
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,053
Is that so?

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:17,017
I guess that would be
a hard thing to tell your daughter.

5
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,977
Oh, my!

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,062
So you understand?

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,231
That's exactly right.

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,400
I'm proud of what I do,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,571
but the details are what they are,
so I just keep putting it off.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,033
Setting that aside,

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,829
we recently received a letter
that contained a certain tip.

12
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,123
The writer of the letter

13
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:45,336
came across a diary full of codes
on their visit to town.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:50,675
Thinking it was suspicious,
they decoded it using frequency analysis,

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,679
and it turned out that the diary
dealt mostly with advanced astronomy.

16
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,765
However, in its latter pages,

17
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,394
the diary suddenly began to propose
an abnormal model of the cosmos.

18
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,857
My superiors felt that
the tip was reliable,

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,609
and they dispatched me.

20
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,030
But unluckily for me,
the sender didn't identify themselves.

21
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:17,243
When that happens,
I have to gather the breadcrumbs myself.

22
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,121
I'll get to the point.

23
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,123
I know it's sudden,

24
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,252
but would you be willing
to show me your research?

25
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,633
Don't worry.
I don't suspect you of anything.

26
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,885
You're friends with my daughter after all.

27
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:39,182
Even so, my orders call for me
to investigate any researchers I find.

28
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,644
Uh, well, that's...

29
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,771
Of course, I don't mind.

30
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,358
Then please lead the way.

31
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,696
This is my study.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,323
I see.

33
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,079
Then if you don't mind...

34
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,541
Huh?

35
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,251
This is...

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,671
It certainly is cluttered in here.

37
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,797
I apologize.

38
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,757
Not at all.

39
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,844
I'm the one making the sudden intrusion.

40
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,931
By the way, what do you research mainly?

41
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,766
Astrology.

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm looking into
the misfortunes that occur

43
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:29,023
when Mars is in opposition to the Sun.

44
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,192
I see.

45
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,279
Hey, that's--

46
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,197
Well?

47
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,702
Yes. This is acceptable.

48
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:46,958
Right.

49
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,545
All clear.

50
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,047
No problems here, either.

51
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,969
Well then.
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

52
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,724
Everything looks fine.

53
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,937
Yes. Naturally.

54
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,725
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

55
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:57,338
{\an8}EPISODE 12
HELIOCENTRISM IS MY FAITH

56
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:17,859
Dear me, it's all so harmless.
I apologize for suspecting you.

57
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,404
I feel rather silly now.

58
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,614
Did I offend you?

59
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,451
No. It's fine.

60
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,205
I really do apologize.

61
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,707
Thanks for your cooperation.

62
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,292
Farewell.

63
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,634
I thought we were done for.

64
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,511
We'd better speed up our plans.

65
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,057
I'll leave here tomorrow or the day after.

66
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,183
You should too.

67
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,103
R-Right.

68
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,147
Luck was on our side today.

69
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,232
I may have hidden the documents,

70
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,069
but I didn't expect him
to leave so easily.

71
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,112
Yeah.

72
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,532
{\an8}He didn't seem to notice
the necklace either.

73
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,160
- The necklace?
- Huh?

74
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,038
You know, that one.

75
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,502
What about this?

76
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,671
Uh, didn't I tell you?

77
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,632
Well...

78
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,678
In my previous job,
I took part in a heretic transfer.

79
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:32,100
That necklace belonged to the heretic.

80
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,103
The inquisitor who accompanied us

81
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,523
was that man, Nowak.

82
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:43,945
A lot happened,
and I ended up fleeing to this village.

83
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,365
But just before my escape,
the heretic gave me that.

84
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,285
Still, Nowak didn't react,

85
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,913
so he must have forgotten.

86
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,084
With all the chaos,
he may not have seen me take it.

87
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,461
Get ready within the next hour.

88
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,754
Huh?

89
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,757
We're leaving immediately.

90
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,512
It's probably okay, but just in case,

91
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,722
we should assume the worst.

92
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,351
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,979
Forget the apologies. Just get ready.

94
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,198
I've finished getting ready.

95
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,658
Good.

96
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,245
Take the tunnel and head for the stable.

97
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:38,082
There, steal a horse
and head to your destination.

98
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,961
What are you going to do, Badeni?

99
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,506
Once the documents are fully burned,

100
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,758
I'll write a letter and then leave.

101
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,762
Then that means

102
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,849
we won't see each other for a while.

103
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,226
Indeed.

104
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,729
Let's meet again as the world turns.

105
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,658
Are you going to burn everything?

106
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,035
Yes.

107
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,538
I'll take what I need most,
but it's dangerous to leave the rest.

108
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,167
But even if it were safe,
I wouldn't leave anything.

109
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,297
As I said before,
this work must be mine alone.

110
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,258
I won't hand over my materials to anyone.

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,805
What is it?

112
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,516
Do you have a complaint now?

113
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,601
N-No, I would never...

114
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,568
Actually,

115
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,237
I do.

116
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,036
Um, if you keep isolating yourself,

117
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,664
won't it be harder to notice mistakes?

118
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,000
And isn't that harmful to research?

119
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,171
Oh, I know it's not my place!

120
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,423
I don't understand academic matters.

121
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,926
I'm merely rambling. Just forget--

122
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,094
I'm listening.

123
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,641
Count Piast

124
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,353
was dissatisfied with the errors
and complications of the current model,

125
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,690
so he tried to discover a new one, right?

126
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,109
Not only that,

127
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,611
he made one that was highly accurate.

128
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,074
That is, compared
to other geocentric models.

129
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,619
So what separates us

130
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,122
from Count Piast?

131
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:47,336
You can challenge
mathematical errors on paper.

132
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,964
But without firm proof,

133
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,507
in the end,

134
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,970
no one can claim with certainty
that heliocentrism is the truth.

135
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,597
{\an8}In that case,

136
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,516
{\an8}the difference
between us and him isn't much.

137
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,727
Even so,

138
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,981
he believed in the possibility
that he was wrong and accepted the truth.

139
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,485
Are you trying to say
that heliocentrism is wrong?

140
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,571
N-No! That's not what I mean.

141
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,742
All I'm trying to say is...

142
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,663
Isn't it important to acknowledge
that you might be wrong?

143
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,626
Especially when it comes to stuff
like scholarship and research.

144
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,755
If you don't allow others
to dispute your ideas,

145
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,756
it's more like...

146
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,175
faith.

147
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:40,431
The sanctity of faith
goes beyond logic or reason,

148
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,934
but shouldn't it be kept separate
from research?

149
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:48,481
That's why it's important to have
other people who can offer criticism.

150
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,816
You shouldn't shut them out.

151
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,568
What made you...

152
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,946
What made you think that?

153
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,117
Long ago,

154
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,537
I learned that such a thing is hope.

155
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,039
Huh?

156
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,710
My former work mentor
and the heretic who gave me the necklace...

157
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,089
<i>After they encountered the stone chest,</i>

158
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,301
<i>they both found hope
in passing the torch to others.</i>

159
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,012
And to my surprise,

160
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,391
that was more important to them
than going to heaven.

161
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,895
It puzzled me for the longest time.

162
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,858
Passing the torch or trusting others
might sound nice in theory,

163
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,363
but you'll never know
if the other person will really carry on.

164
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,989
Worse than that,

165
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,952
they might reject your plans in the end.

166
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,540
In that sense, entrusting things to others
is scary, not hopeful.

167
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,168
But in fact,

168
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,380
maybe having others refute
or correct your ideas

169
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,632
is what passing the torch really means.

170
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,009
Things don't go as planned.

171
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,555
Misunderstandings
or unexpected events occur.

172
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,642
The believer is opposed by the heretic.

173
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,145
Heliocentrism is opposed by
the geocentric model.

174
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,648
The twists brought on
by those outside elements

175
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,610
might be the very thing
that gives you hope

176
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,404
to move forward.

177
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,785
Oh, but when it comes to heliocentrism,

178
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,955
it's too dangerous
to tell others, of course.

179
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,291
I see what you mean.

180
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,877
However, I don't agree.

181
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,464
What you're saying
is incredibly dangerous.

182
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:41,385
As I said, I'm only speaking
about your stance toward research.

183
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,845
When it comes to faith--

184
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,930
It's the stance that is dangerous.

185
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,435
Applying that stance to research

186
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:54,190
would mean abandoning the absolute truth,
which should always be our goal.

187
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,361
Scholars would swim forever
in the waters of imperfection.

188
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,115
You're asking us to accept
such a tragedy with open arms?

189
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,535
Yes.

190
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,828
Isn't that better

191
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,665
than forever believing in a mistake?

192
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,257
We'll debate that thought at a later date.

193
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,928
It's pointless to stay here any longer.

194
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,472
Okay.

195
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,558
Well then. Until we meet again.

196
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,227
Right.

197
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,395
Thank you for all you've done for me.

198
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,619
What is it?

199
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,870
Aren't you going?

200
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,207
- They're coming.
- Huh?

201
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,751
A carriage is coming.

202
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,926
<i>It's the inquisitors' carriage.</i>

203
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,055
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

204
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:08,973
{\an8}<i>Orb.</i>

205
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,145
How long before they reach here?

206
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,775
Um... probably four or five minutes.

207
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,903
Damn it!

208
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,870
Throw that in the fire!
Then hit the tunnel and run!

209
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,787
But...

210
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,706
I'll follow when I gather my things.

211
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,832
Uh, right!

212
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,378
Didn't you say
you were going to write a letter?

213
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,131
Huh? There's no time for that!

214
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,058
Can we have a little chat?

215
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,144
Uh, yes.

216
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,982
I'm not trying to push
my personal concerns onto you,

217
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,820
but this particular case is special to me.

218
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,531
It's because

219
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,284
the heretics we're pursuing

220
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,995
have approached my family.

221
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,665
So, at the moment,

222
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,627
I'm in a peculiar mood.

223
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,754
To put it simply...

224
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,382
{\an8}I'm pissed off.

225
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,096
Was that letter something important?

226
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,848
Of course it was!

227
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,767
I had a plan!

228
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,227
But there's no use now.

229
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,688
Besides, just writing it is pointless!

230
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,941
As of yesterday, I could have sent it.

231
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,736
But after today, all letters to the church
will be intercepted.

232
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,571
Even if I managed to write it,

233
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,616
I'd have to take it to the church
via the tunnel.

234
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,951
There's no time for that!

235
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:56,205
I don't even have time
to explain this to you!

236
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,168
Even if you give up on that,

237
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,671
we only have five minutes.

238
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,005
What?

239
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,675
How long would you need to flee safely?

240
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,219
It's meaningless to speculate!

241
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,845
How many minutes do you need?

242
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,684
Around ten minutes.

243
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,241
Hey.

244
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,743
Do you intend to die?

245
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,580
I don't know.

246
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,251
But I do know that I can buy time.

247
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,754
Are you that stupid?

248
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,216
You'd be drawing your sword on clergymen.

249
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,262
At this rate,
they're likely to capture us both.

250
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,142
If that's the case,
at least one of us should get away.

251
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,020
I don't think you understand.

252
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,855
You'd almost certainly

253
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,817
be condemning yourself to hell.

254
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,904
Why should you condemn your soul
for the sake of this research?

255
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,951
Before, you asked me
why I decided to write a book.

256
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,327
Huh?

257
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,038
It's probably because

258
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,582
when I learned
the meaning of heliocentrism,

259
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,626
it inspired me.

260
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,547
That inspiration has grown day by day.

261
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,674
What are you trying to say?

262
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,301
I'm saying that

263
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,764
there was a time not long ago
when I was desperate to leave for heaven.

264
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,393
But now, if it will protect
that inspiration,

265
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,562
I'm ready for hell.

266
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,403
<i>This is what it means...
to learn something, I think.</i>

267
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,324
{\an8}You're making a mistake.

268
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,076
Am I?

269
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,786
Yes. You are.

270
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,538
It's people like you

271
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,458
who have never studied theology
and are ignorant of hell

272
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,169
that tend to make bad choices.

273
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,797
Even if that's true,

274
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,382
I won't regret it.

275
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,554
{\an8}Have you forgotten
the speech you gave me earlier?

276
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,309
You said it was important
to accept criticism from others.

277
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,232
To involve yourself in such a way
with a scholarly theory like heliocentrism

278
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,817
is a grave mistake.

279
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,653
Yes. You're right.

280
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,321
But even so...

281
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,576
<i>Heliocentrism is my faith.</i>

282
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,415
Wait.

283
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,543
Lord God,

284
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,838
our savior has promised us.

285
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,050
"I am the resurrection and the life:

286
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,137
he that believeth on me,
though he die, yet shall he live."

287
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,806
O merciful God,

288
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,726
take this man whom you have called
from life to yourself.

289
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,606
Welcome him safely
to the promised kingdom.

290
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,360
Absolve him of every bond of sin,

291
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,115
and let him live among those
you have chosen in eternal light.

292
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,370
May he be raised in the glory
of the resurrection.

293
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,873
In the name of our Lord.

294
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,667
Amen.

295
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
Whoa!

296
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,814
Oh?

297
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,150
Well, well...

298
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,321
I wasn't expecting a welcome party.

299
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,164
Ready your fire.

300
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,878
Give yourself up!

301
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,881
Why do all this
just for that stupid theory?

302
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,593
Because I want to have hope
for this world.

303
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,930
I won't surrender, but couldn't we talk?

304
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,807
Fire at will.

305
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,636
By the way, do you have battle experience?

306
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,264
It's my first time.

307
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,559
This is the best I get, huh?

308
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,477
What?

309
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,855
Forget it. It's nothing.

310
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,443
Sir, I am here to fulfill my duty.

311
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,072
Yeah, I suppose.

312
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:27,411
But fulfilling your duty
comes down to individual will.

313
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,832
The will to put your life in danger.

314
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,085
{\an8}Are you ready for that?

315
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,713
{\an8}Yes, sir!

316
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,553
Years ago, my sibling
was killed by a madman.

317
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:50,058
The investigation concluded that
the killer was possessed by the devil.

318
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,812
I wouldn't say I harbor a grudge,

319
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,441
but I'm prepared to kill heretics.

320
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,653
{\an8}That's good to hear.

321
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:06,158
But it's not quite what I meant.

322
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,288
I was once a mercenary.

323
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:16,126
You might look down on such bloody work,

324
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,879
but it taught me many things.

325
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:24,718
A truly strong warrior
is not one who's ready to kill.

326
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,764
It's one who is ready to die.

327
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:36,396
In battle, crude determination
is superior to superficial skill.

328
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,776
So what I'm really asking
is if you're prepared to die

329
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,862
for your murdered sibling's sake.

330
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,530
{\an8}Yes!

331
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,967
Seriously?

332
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,595
Come on...

333
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,932
This is why new recruits are useless.

334
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,235
You're not prepared to die, are you?

335
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,029
We're about to find out.

336
