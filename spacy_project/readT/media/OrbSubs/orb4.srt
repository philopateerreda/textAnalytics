1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>No matter when I look,</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,757
<i>the night sky is always beautiful.</i>

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>So why...</i>

4
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:31,823
Why must our world be an ugly place?

5
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:36,369
It's because the Earth
is at the center of the universe.

6
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,873
But wouldn't that make it special?

7
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,459
To be at the center

8
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,961
is to be at the bottom.

9
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,132
<i>At every location on Earth,</i>

10
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,468
<i>heavy objects fall downward.</i>

11
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>That is because Earth's center</i>

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,973
is the lowest point in the universe.

13
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,518
That's how God created things.

14
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,645
But why?

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,899
God made the Earth
a lowly place full of corruption

16
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:11,613
to remind us that humankind
is helpless and sinful.

17
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,992
The sky above looks so beautiful

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,370
because you are gazing at it
from this corrupt realm.

19
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,208
If Earth is at the bottom of the universe,

20
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,377
why don't the stars fall from the sky?

21
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,214
I don't know.

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:33,551
We humans can only comprehend
the realm in which we live.

23
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,680
The heavens are sublime, solemn,

24
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,891
sacred, and sweeping.

25
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,478
They don't mingle with the lowly Earth.

26
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,035
Sorry. Have I kept you waiting, Oczy?

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,995
Not at all, Gras.

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,083
The stars look so beautiful
on such a clear night.

29
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,460
It never fails to amaze me!

30
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,714
Every evening, the stars share
the rich splendor of their glow.

31
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,552
Don't you ever have a look?

32
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,763
With your eyes,
I'm sure the stars are quite vivid.

33
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,182
No, uh... I...

34
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,103
I don't like to gaze at the sky.

35
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,188
I see.

36
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,190
Oh, that's right!

37
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,861
Today marks one year
since you transferred to our chapter.

38
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,655
When work is done, let's celebrate.

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,241
My treat, of course.

40
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,493
Oh, uh... Thank you very much.

41
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,708
Now then. Let's get to work.

42
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,775
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

43
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:24,180
{\an8}EPISODE FOUR: THE FACT THAT THIS WORLD
IS FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HEAVEN

44
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,726
I'll do it.

45
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,144
Thanks.

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,440
We're members of the Civilian Watch.

47
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,610
I will serve as witness.

48
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,697
Please allow us to wear masks

49
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,491
so that we may avoid personal retribution.

50
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,163
Now, let's begin.

51
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,379
Commence the duel.

52
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,066
W-Wait!

53
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,820
It was Count Nastula
who I challenged to a duel!

54
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:25,658
Why does someone of my stature
have to fight you peasants?

55
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,202
Count Nastula hired us

56
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,331
to fight as his champions.

57
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,043
I believe you approved it too.

58
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,005
B-But if I...

59
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,050
If I lose, I'll die!

60
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,677
Correct. That's the way it works.

61
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,769
<i>Gotcha!</i>

62
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,703
N-No...

63
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,330
I don't want to die.

64
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,833
I know! I have money!

65
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,001
Let's make a deal!

66
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,129
You have nothing against me, right?

67
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,715
Murder is a terrible sin!

68
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,385
You don't really want to do this, do you?

69
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,178
Well...

70
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,014
To be honest, I really don't.

71
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,474
I-In that case--

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,353
But this is my job.

73
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,364
B-Burn...

74
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,784
in...

75
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,577
hell.

76
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,381
I've handed over the body.

77
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,426
That takes care of tonight's work.

78
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,303
Still, your reflexes impress me.

79
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,013
You really do have good eyes.

80
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,891
Huh? Are you okay?

81
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,479
D-Do you think he went to heaven?

82
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,275
You're concerned?

83
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,569
I'm worried.

84
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,823
Doing this work, I've seen
many people face imminent death.

85
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,453
{\an8}But not a single one
seemed to die in satisfaction.

86
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,124
{\an8}They all passed away in terror.

87
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,711
{\an8}As if they saw the entrance to hell.

88
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,633
Could it be that
only a handful of people go to heaven?

89
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,304
If so, a murderer like me
will never make it.

90
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,139
Oczy.

91
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,225
What do you like best about our world?

92
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,520
Why ask me that?

93
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,900
It's inappropriate to like anything
about this corrupt realm.

94
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,776
Come on, that's not true!

95
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,612
Enjoyment can't be bad.

96
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,906
With nothing to look forward to,

97
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,117
our souls plunge instantly into darkness.

98
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,828
Things like love, dreams, and hope

99
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,372
should never be cast aside!

100
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,002
I guess you're right.

101
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,630
I'll rethink my outlook.

102
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,257
Oh, sorry.

103
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,510
I've made you nervous.

104
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,055
Please be frank,
and tell me what you really think.

105
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,350
But... my opinion doesn't matter.

106
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,268
Don't be so shy!

107
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,020
We've known each other for a year.

108
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,730
Don't hold back!

109
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,823
I believe expectations
are bound to be betrayed.

110
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,369
You'll be less hurt if you give up
from the very beginning.

111
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,706
Or rather, nothing enjoyable
ever happens in life anyway.

112
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,708
The only ones who can be happy

113
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,836
are a select few born with that privilege.

114
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,424
For those who aren't chosen,
even trying to be happy is useless.

115
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,342
Our world is sick.

116
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,927
And that's why

117
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,929
the only hope is in heaven.

118
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,057
Heaven is wonderful.

119
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,935
I wanna go now.

120
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,316
Just kidding.

121
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,068
In other words,

122
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,029
because there's nothing
perfect or eternal here,

123
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,656
you can't trust anything?

124
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,908
No, I--

125
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,909
I get it!

126
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,369
In truth,

127
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,205
I was just like you not long ago.

128
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,083
But then I found it.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,044
Something worthy of absolute hope.

130
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,213
Wanna know what?

131
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,923
No, not particularly.

132
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,634
This time, you can feign interest.

133
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,555
I want to know.

134
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,020
- Hey, those guys...
- Yeah, they're assassins.

135
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,438
Here we are.

136
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,023
Two cups of wine, please!

137
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,940
Huh?

138
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,110
This tavern is frequented by the nobility.

139
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,904
Duelists like you should leave.

140
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,574
I'm sorry if we've offended you.

141
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:21,037
However, this tavern
is also open to us guild members.

142
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,497
So I hope you'll allow us to stay.

143
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,000
- You've got it wrong, Gras.
- Huh?

144
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,919
With people like him,
you have to be more direct.

145
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,676
I'm sorry for being born!

146
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,762
C-Cut it out! That's enough!

147
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,096
I'm sorry for being born!

148
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,560
See? If you apologize sincerely,
they'll forgive you.

149
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,479
Uh, right.

150
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,064
Thanks for that.

151
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,692
Now then. Let's pick up where we left off.

152
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,693
Left off?

153
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,695
Huh? You know!

154
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,156
We were talking about the hope I found.

155
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,451
Oh, right. Of course, I remember.

156
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,208
Here it is.

157
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,794
It contains my observations of Mars.

158
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,462
Mars?

159
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,005
What's that?

160
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,591
I guess we start there, huh?

161
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,303
<i>You're aware that the constellations</i>

162
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,555
<i>are always arranged the same, right?</i>

163
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,432
<i>Their appearance never changes,</i>

164
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,768
<i>and every night,
they move from east to west</i>

165
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,353
<i>until morning comes.</i>

166
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,106
But one day,

167
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,650
<i>as I was looking aimlessly
up at the stars,</i>

168
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,694
<i>I noticed something incredible.</i>

169
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,698
<i>Among the fixed constellations in the sky,</i>

170
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,366
<i>some stars move!</i>

171
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,911
They move ever so slightly
in a single night.

172
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,330
But if you watch for days,

173
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,290
their positions clearly change!

174
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,209
I was fascinated,

175
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,961
so I asked a monk.

176
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,297
The moving stars are called "planets,"

177
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,717
and I learned there are as many as five.

178
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,555
<i>The one I found
had the most obvious movements of all.</i>

179
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,725
<i>It's a planet called Mars,
and it has a fiery red glow.</i>

180
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,768
<i>From that day on,</i>

181
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,146
<i>I decided to record
the trajectory of Mars.</i>

182
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
<i>And what did I find?</i>

183
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,318
<i>Mars moves through
the constellations in a circular path!</i>

184
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,612
<i>For one month, six months, or a year,</i>

185
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,116
<i>its circular orbit continues without fail.</i>

186
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,078
Swaying grass,
flowing rivers, wavering flames...

187
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,956
There are many things that move in nature,

188
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,751
but none as consistently as this.

189
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,086
It is true perfection!

190
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,880
Then I realized something.

191
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,758
This world certainly is
corrupt and disorderly.

192
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,011
It could never match
the grand perfection of the sky.

193
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:46,515
Even so, we can still
gaze at that perfection!

194
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,851
Humankind can recognize perfect things.

195
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,480
And unlike the sun,
we can look at Mars directly.

196
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,858
The Earth gives us the best seats
in the house for observation.

197
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,445
Looking at it that way,
humankind and the Earth aren't so bad.

198
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,617
Thanks to that realization,
I feel positive about everything!

199
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,119
And now, after two years of observation,

200
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,623
<i>the orbit of Mars
will complete its circle.</i>

201
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,584
The grand finale will soon be here!

202
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,171
Oh? Wow.

203
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,673
<i>That's a pretty big stretch.</i>

204
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,926
That's a pretty big stretch.

205
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,095
It must take a lot of will.

206
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,724
The perfect circular path of Mars?

207
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,436
I envy you peasants and your ignorance.

208
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,565
I'm sorry to draw your attention again,

209
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,235
but nothing you say
will change how I feel.

210
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,487
Go ahead and laugh all you want.

211
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,365
No, I'm sorry for interrupting.

212
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,450
Feel free to enjoy yourselves.

213
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,788
However, you did choose
the wrong time to begin observation.

214
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,457
Otherwise, you would have noticed sooner.

215
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,293
Whatever you say.

216
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,800
Th-This can't be!

217
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,470
What's wrong?

218
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,931
Every day...

219
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,351
It moved every day for the past two years.

220
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,728
{\an8}Lately,

221
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,023
I'd noticed that
the movements seemed slower.

222
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,734
But today...

223
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,237
Mars went completely still.

224
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,949
{\an8}It hasn't moved at all since yesterday.

225
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,618
{\an8}How could this be?

226
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,874
I waited two years,
and it was about to complete its circle.

227
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,961
Why?

228
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,678
Hey, Oczy!

229
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,306
Done with work?

230
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,142
No, I'm on my way now.

231
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,811
It must be tough

232
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,772
being paired with a weirdo like Gras.

233
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,190
Not at all.

234
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,484
He's a very optimistic person.

235
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,111
That's the problem!

236
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,616
Gras used to be

237
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,285
a fairly average guy.

238
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,829
He complained as much as anyone.

239
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,956
But at one point,

240
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,709
his entire family died of the plague.

241
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,669
That was when

242
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,882
he lost all hope
and tried to end his own life.

243
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,760
H-His life has been that tragic?

244
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,015
<i>The biggest tragedy
was that he failed to die.</i>

245
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,520
<i>The Church forgave him for that sin,</i>

246
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,024
<i>but the truth is that
he regretted having survived.</i>

247
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,194
<i>He said, "Is this really my fate?"</i>

248
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,240
<i>But then, over the past year or two,
he's suddenly grown cheerful.</i>

249
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,617
<i>When I asked him why,</i>

250
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,535
<i>he said he'd been stargazing.</i>

251
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,998
<i>"The stars are a message
from my family in heaven," he said.</i>

252
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,875
<i>Be careful.</i>

253
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,253
<i>Unstable people like him
are unpredictable.</i>

254
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,883
Things like love, dreams, and hope

255
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,386
should never be cast aside!

256
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,480
It bent.

257
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,984
It bent

258
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,152
in the opposite direction.

259
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,991
{\an8}The perfect circle is broken.

260
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,703
It's hideously deformed.

261
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,212
Is this really

262
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,298
my fate?

263
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,975
Good evening.

264
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,310
Hello. Shall we go?

265
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,191
Will there be no stargazing tonight?

266
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,860
Well...

267
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,778
As you said,

268
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,198
maybe it's a mistake to expect
something from this world,

269
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,576
rather than from heaven.

270
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,497
Anyway, today's task is...

271
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,125
Now there's a change.

272
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,169
We're guarding the transport of a heretic.

273
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,087
A h-heretic?!

274
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,256
They may be communing with the devil.

275
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,759
- Better be careful!
- Huh?

276
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,095
Are you from the Civilian Watch?

277
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,184
I'm the inquisitor, Damian.

278
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,365
The men from the Watch are here.

279
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,785
Let's go, Nowak.

280
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,245
What are you looking at?

281
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,663
A charm.

282
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,919
I guess the boring shift begins now.

283
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,763
Is it okay to remove your mask?

284
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,684
There's no harm in being seen
by a heretic who's about to die.

285
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,895
Oh? I see.

286
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,190
How unfortunate that it should be raining.

287
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,776
It means I can't see the stars.

288
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,826
Aren't you two
interested in the night sky?

289
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,954
Stargazing can be quite relaxing.

290
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,289
We're not allowed

291
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,959
to speak with you.

292
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,044
Could you remain quiet?

293
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,047
Will you strike me if I don't?

294
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,135
To tell the truth,
I pity you too much to hit you.

295
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,472
Why defy the very church
that brings you salvation?

296
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,476
Why would you give up
your own place in heaven?

297
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,148
Unfortunately for you,
execution is unavoidable.

298
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,193
But you could still reconsider
and recant before you die.

299
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,280
How merciful of you.

300
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,284
But you're the ones who should reconsider.

301
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,163
Will the Church
really bring you salvation?

302
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:29,084
More importantly, does the heaven
they speak of really exist?

303
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,590
A heretic like you would never understand.

304
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,177
And what exactly do <i>you</i> understand?

305
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,556
{\an8}You all turn blindly to heaven

306
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,185
{\an8}as a way to escape
the hopelessness of this world.

307
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,314
We know what you're trying to do.

308
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,858
You're playing on our anxieties,

309
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,861
so you can push us toward despair.

310
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,821
No.

311
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,825
{\an8}You're the ones pushing despair away.

312
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,620
The philosophy of today

313
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:09,917
was born when an elderly Athenian drank
from a poisoned chalice 2,000 years ago.

314
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:15,005
The Church of today grew from grief
over a young man's crucifixion

315
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,424
1,500 years ago.

316
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,260
{\an8}Humankind is known to produce new hope

317
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,096
{\an8}from the ashes of tragedy.

318
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,808
Temporary relief from pain

319
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,685
will never change reality.

320
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,438
But primal suffering,

321
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,774
seething frustration,

322
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,776
or even your own despair

323
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,320
can be turned into hope.

324
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,406
{\an8}Yet, you close your eyes to that despair

325
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,285
and turn instead to the thirdhand
guarantee of life after death.

326
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,705
Hope will never smile
upon people like you.

327
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,001
I've had enough of your drivel!

328
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,336
You know nothing!

329
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,338
Gras, get a hold of yourself!

330
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,298
Don't fall for the heretic's trap!

331
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,425
"Heretic," huh?

332
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:05,347
I know all too well why you fear
people who are called that.

333
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,976
It's not because you don't understand me.

334
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,185
It's the opposite.

335
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,396
Deep down,

336
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,358
you yourselves do not
fully believe in heaven.

337
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,735
You don't speak for me.

338
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,448
In fact, there is no heaven,
and death is the end.

339
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,117
Isn't that what you think?

340
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,618
It's not.

341
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,079
I understand why you worry.

342
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,873
Losing your appointment
in the afterlife is hard.

343
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,750
Don't say another word.

344
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,335
But in fact, you...

345
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,380
No, all humankind
should confront that possibility.

346
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,506
Stop it.

347
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,675
{\an8}The simple possibility

348
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,344
{\an8}that your beautiful heaven doesn't exist!

349
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,805
I asked you to stop!

350
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:54,187
Worse, you ignore the fact that this world
is far more beautiful than heaven.

351
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,318
What are you--

352
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,070
You want to believe it too, don't you?

353
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,950
That this world
is a wonderful place worth living on.

354
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,206
Forget it. That's enough.

355
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,333
It's ridiculous.

356
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,836
If we stop and think,
it's all baseless rambling.

357
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,088
I have evidence.

358
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,381
Is that so?

359
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,633
Well, you don't have it here.

360
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,345
No, it's right at this spot.

361
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,848
Right on that mountain you see now.

362
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,893
All the evidence

363
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,229
is in a stone chest
hidden on the mountainside.

364
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,442
Now, do you understand
the position you're in?

365
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,238
On this very night,
you two have been given

366
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,240
the momentary chance

367
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,036
to change your own lives
for the first time.

368
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,332
Will you stick to the comfort
of lifelong self-denial?

369
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,960
Or will you risk everything
for self-affirmation?

370
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,589
The choice is yours.

371
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,092
So, what will it be?

372
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,887
A-As if...

373
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,808
Huh?

374
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,819
Please.

375
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,917
