{\an8}EPISODE 18
TO LIBERATE INFORMATION

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,342
{\an8}You're a Church authority, aren't you?

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,178
Should you really be doing this?

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,266
A nomad like you has no room to talk.

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,059
Show some respect.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:23,898
Our Church was more than happy
to welcome you itinerants as converts.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,443
We gave you civilization.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,319
Hmm?

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,156
You people are all the same.

10
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,451
You think you are rational and superior,

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,828
while others are primitive and inferior.

12
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,581
You say you'll guide others
down the right path,

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,333
but you actually continue excluding them.

14
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:46,463
My people converted
several generations ago,

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
but we still face discrimination.

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,218
Doesn't that go against
the teachings of the Holy Scripture?

17
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,597
It's no wonder
divisions within the Church are growing.

18
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,267
- Oh?
- Hold it!

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,102
Don't talk to the Bishop like that!

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,938
This man told us something.

21
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,483
He said you have a shred of intelligence.

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,488
You instructed people to collect fabrics
from the abandoned villages, right?

23
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,115
Why fabrics?

24
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,911
Most people would aim
for something more valuable.

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,790
{\an8}Finding valuables takes time,

26
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,708
{\an8}and there's obviously more competition.

27
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,543
But most importantly,

28
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,047
money alone is not the key to earning.

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,345
If all we have is money, it only depletes.

30
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,390
That's why looking for money itself
isn't a good strategy.

31
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,770
To really earn money,
what we need is to produce.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,315
That's where fabrics come in.

33
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,402
They can easily be turned into
clothes, dressings, or even pouches.

34
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,114
In other words, easily made products!

35
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,743
Um, Bishop--

36
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,662
I see. Then tell me this.

37
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,625
What do you think will happen
to Church authority in the future?

38
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,044
W-What are you--

39
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,087
Answer me.

40
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,674
I think it will waver.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,968
How do we stop that?

42
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,094
You can't.

43
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,973
So if you want to maintain your wealth,

44
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,683
you'd better act soon.

45
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,770
That means correctly assessing the future.

46
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,691
And you can do that?

47
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,359
Who knows?

48
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,070
But if I can't, I'll merely die.

49
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,661
Come to the church immediately.

50
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,831
I want to talk more.

51
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,709
Huh? Wait...

52
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,043
Um, what about me?

53
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,128
Do as you please.

54
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,466
Draka, I've always believed in you.

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,927
I knew you'd find a way out of--

56
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,596
Stop talking.

57
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,433
Which church are we going to?

58
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,060
We'll descend to the southwest, and--

59
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,896
Oh, that town?

60
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,485
By the way, what is that book?

61
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,239
Oh, this is...

62
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>What do I do?</i>

63
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,829
<i>This heliocentrism thing</i>

64
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,081
<i>goes against the church's teachings.</i>

65
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,334
Hand it over.

66
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,840
<i>But maybe this Bishop...</i>

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,752
{\an8}ORB: ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH

68
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,781
W-We're under attack!

69
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,423
What are you doing? Defend me!

70
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,382
Retreat!

71
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,426
Hey, they're getting away!

72
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,678
Let them go, Lewandowski.

73
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,764
It's time for us to go too.

74
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,809
Still, isn't it too much of a coincidence?

75
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,063
Running into church officials again...

76
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,774
Yeah, talk about rotten luck.

77
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,488
That's exactly why it feels like fate.

78
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,408
Where could God be leading us this time?

79
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,287
{\an8}- Uncle?
- D-Draka...

80
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,539
{\an8}H-Help me...

81
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,209
{\an8}You were ready to sell me out just now.

82
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,543
{\an8}The audacity you have.

83
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,590
Is this what you wanted, Uncle?

84
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,427
Your conviction
is about to lead you to hell.

85
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,514
I told you.

86
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,478
There is... no hell.

87
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,232
Damn... it.

88
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,572
- You.
- Huh?

89
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,829
Who... are you people?

90
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,705
The better question is who are you?

91
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,958
Why do you have that book?

92
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,045
I found it by chance in that house.

93
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,463
I see.

94
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,924
It belongs to us.

95
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,467
Give it back.

96
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,304
What exactly is this book?

97
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,142
All I can say is that
it's not meant for you.

98
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,727
Hand it over.

99
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,149
My uncle is dead because of you people.

100
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,444
Don't you owe me more of an explanation?

101
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,530
I apologize for that.

102
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,366
That book is important.

103
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,619
That's the explanation. Hand it over.

104
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,873
Important? Important how?

105
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,710
We didn't come here to chat.

106
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,713
We came to reclaim the book.

107
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,716
You merely found it by chance.

108
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,219
This has nothing to do with you.

109
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,391
Consider that my final warning.

110
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,519
Hand it over. I don't want to use force.

111
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,149
Could it be that I'm destined

112
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,652
to live my whole life here, as I am?

113
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,364
One day, that conviction
will show you the way.

114
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,203
With that, you'll have the courage
to stand your ground.

115
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,750
<i>If I let this moment pass... I'll never...</i>

116
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,716
You people came here today
to reclaim this book.

117
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,135
I have nothing to do with it.

118
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,931
Even so, you'll have to forgive me...

119
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,186
because I came here tonight
to change my fate.

120
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,774
W-What are you doing?!

121
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,943
I know the contents.

122
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,403
Maybe not perfectly,
but I have a good memory.

123
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,780
Who'd believe that?!

124
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,448
{\an8}You have no choice.

125
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,035
Frei.

126
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,788
Do you remember the contents?

127
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,874
If you do, I'll dispose of this girl.

128
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,169
No, I never finished reading it.

129
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,379
As for the contents...

130
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,339
I was careless.

131
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,760
It's fine. I'm at fault
for allowing it to be burnt.

132
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,472
I'm sorry, everyone.

133
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,517
We'll have to take her to the leader.

134
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,479
Are you sure?

135
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,022
There's no other way.

136
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,566
It's fate.

137
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,443
Come with us!

138
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,862
Th-Thank you.

139
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,917
So long, Uncle.

140
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,552
Well, Frei?

141
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,305
She really does seem to remember.

142
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,933
Although I can only confirm
the half that I read.

143
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,810
How about it?

144
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,146
Do you trust me a little now?

145
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,696
I'm Draka. Pleased to meet you.

146
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,949
I'm Lewandowski.

147
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,909
I'm Frei.

148
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,037
And I'm their Captain, Schmidt.

149
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,540
We're members
of the Heretic Liberation Front.

150
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,376
{\an8}That was a poor way to meet,

151
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,171
{\an8}but if you're coming with us,
there's no need to fight.

152
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,798
{\an8}Let us deepen
our understanding of one another

153
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,009
{\an8}and cooperate to achieve our mutual goals.

154
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,261
{\an8}I hope work can proceed smoothly.

155
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,097
{\an8}In other words,
what we need now is dialogue.

156
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,599
Right.

157
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,601
{\an8}<i>He's so long-winded.</i>

158
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,978
{\an8}So first, why did you burn the book?

159
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,107
What motivated you
to want to come with us so badly?

160
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,365
I sensed I could make money
if I'm involved with that book.

161
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,242
Earning money is my conviction.

162
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,871
Conviction?

163
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,918
I hold convictions myself,
so I can sympathize.

164
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,753
Although mine are loftier.

165
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,841
However, I'd like you to prepare.

166
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,386
Everything you are about to see

167
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,554
will be painful for one who believes

168
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,223
in the Church orthodoxy.

169
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,433
I don't mind that.

170
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,268
I'm not one of the faithful.

171
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,186
Huh?

172
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,022
I'm not interested
in interpreting the Holy Scripture.

173
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,358
Oh my, you too?!

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,402
That makes things easier.

175
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,986
We feel the same way.

176
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,197
Y-You do?!

177
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,951
Then do you also think
the Church's class system is ridiculous?

178
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,577
Yes! Of course.

179
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,623
And you don't believe this world
was created for humanity's sake?

180
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,791
Of course not!

181
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,293
Then you don't believe in God either.

182
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,340
Huh?

183
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,593
What does that mean?

184
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,807
Is your heresy against something
other than Church orthodoxy?

185
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,685
No, I don't believe in God.

186
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,602
What?

187
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,771
So you believe in another religion?

188
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,857
No, I don't believe in God.

189
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,817
So, in other words...

190
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,821
{\an8}You don't believe in God?

191
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,324
That's what I just said.

192
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,414
- Um...
- Wait!

193
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,874
I need a moment.

194
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,755
I see!

195
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,214
So this is fate too.

196
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,886
First off, I've never met anyone
who held such a belief.

197
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,764
To be honest, I'm quite unsettled

198
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,390
to the point of rage.

199
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,017
But at the same time,

200
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,479
I realize now that this is the fate
God has assigned me.

201
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,023
I will accept that.

202
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,609
But when our involvement is over,

203
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,321
I hope that your fate
is to vanish as soon as possible.

204
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,573
Uh, right.

205
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,533
<i>He's so long-winded.</i>

206
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,291
I guess that means
you all have a firm belief in God.

207
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,418
It's no mere belief.

208
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,753
There is a God.

209
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,380
The proof is that the world exists.

210
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,174
So there must be a maker.

211
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,302
However, God has no personality,

212
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,804
nor can they be interpreted.

213
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,806
All I do

214
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,642
is worship the natural world God created.

215
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,438
Hold on.

216
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,945
Isn't worshiping nature itself
a kind of interpretation?

217
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,739
No, that is incorrect.

218
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,744
The reason is that
I'm simply doing what I enjoy.

219
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,163
It comes from feeling, not logic.

220
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,082
It's not an interpretation.

221
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,211
By the same token, I despise religion

222
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,296
not because it is illogical,

223
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,923
but because it is logical.

224
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,093
God's motives could never
be understood by humans.

225
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,679
God made the vast natural world,

226
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,139
but it's not for the sake of humankind.

227
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,268
God defines my fate,

228
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,478
but I don't know where I'll be led.

229
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,980
Uh...

230
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,982
Well, I'll put it simply.

231
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,902
I place no trust
in the intellect of people

232
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,696
who attempt to understand.

233
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,994
Then I'm afraid I can't agree.

234
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,205
After all,

235
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,791
people use their intellect
and logic for progress.

236
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,961
If we abandon that,
how will society evolve?

237
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,384
The concepts of progress or evolution

238
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,469
are unnatural in and of themselves.

239
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,932
{\an8}Make what you need,
when and where you need it.

240
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,851
{\an8}Isn't that enough?

241
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,605
{\an8}The unnatural desire
for comfort leads to conflict

242
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,565
{\an8}and a chaotic world.

243
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,525
{\an8}Oh?

244
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,613
{\an8}Even so, I think some lives
are saved by technology.

245
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,532
{\an8}Should lives that were destined to end

246
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,827
{\an8}be saved by unnatural means?

247
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,873
{\an8}No human life should take priority
over what God has determined.

248
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,627
That's ridiculous!
It would make us God's slaves!

249
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,213
Well, I'd prefer that
to human pride and conceit.

250
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,925
Is that so?

251
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,636
I don't think you're the least bit right.

252
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,639
I can say the same for you.

253
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,226
It seems further dialogue is meaningless.

254
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,356
How about this? At times like these...

255
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,444
Heads, I'm right.

256
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,655
Tails, you're right.

257
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,994
Look at that. It's heads.

258
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,872
It seems I'm right this time.

259
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,541
What's your point?

260
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,752
I never agreed to accept the result.

261
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,714
In the first place,
I don't leave such things to chance.

262
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,134
Well, you'll understand one day.

263
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,595
Hmm?

264
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,557
It's time.

265
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,976
Stop the carriage.

266
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
Yes, sir!

267
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,070
Huh? What's going on?

268
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,531
It's the start of a new day.

269
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,889
Um, what are you doing?

270
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,183
I'm bathing in the morning sun.

271
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,602
When I do that, I feel it.

272
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,396
Feel what?

273
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,398
God.

274
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,862
You got out just for this?

275
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,323
I was <i>born</i> just for this.

276
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,493
I don't get it.

277
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,746
Why don't you come out?

278
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,792
Do you feel nothing
in the presence of this majestic dawn?

279
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,880
I do feel something.

280
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,800
Agony.

281
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,928
What?

282
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,267
Dawn illuminates everything,
whether you like it or not.

283
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,022
<i>Even when you want to hide
or turn your eyes away,</i>

284
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,774
<i>it still comes.</i>

285
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,277
<i>And there's never a day
when the sun doesn't rise.</i>

286
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,404
<i>No one can run from it.</i>

287
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,787
It reminds me of "fate,"
that word I despise.

288
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,955
The morning sun disgusts me.

289
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,881
Even if I die, I'll never understand
what's so great about it.

290
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,844
Is that so?

291
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,388
- Then go ahead and die.
- Huh?!

292
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,349
I just said, "Even if I die"!

293
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,809
Don't give up so easily.

294
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,144
You never know until you try.

295
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,820
Anyway, if we're done debating,
will you answer my question?

296
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,532
What do you intend to do with that book?

297
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,118
We'll arrive soon.

298
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,163
Isn't it about time you told us
what our mission is too?

299
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,959
Yes, you're right.

300
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,379
{\an8}Are you all aware

301
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,216
{\an8}of the three inventions that are poised

302
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,218
{\an8}to shake up the world?

303
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,388
The first is explosives.

304
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,266
The second is the compass.

305
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,478
And then there's the third,
which concerns us the most.

306
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,982
Movable type!

307
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,277
Movable type?

308
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,695
Yes.

309
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,947
The traditional methods of copying books

310
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,407
are handwritten manuscripts

311
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,743
or making woodblock prints of each page.

312
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,289
However, movable type is different.

313
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,374
<i>The procedure is simple.</i>

314
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,794
<i>First, you make molds
called type for each letter.</i>

315
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,172
<i>Next, you line them up
and make a letterpress.</i>

316
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,674
<i>Then, you cover them with ink</i>

317
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,552
<i>and apply the letterpress to paper.</i>

318
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,138
<i>Through that process alone...</i>

319
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,391
Through that alone--

320
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,268
You can mass-produce manuscripts

321
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,021
with astonishing speed
and uniform quality.

322
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,900
What an idea... It's incredible.

323
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,281
The book's content,
the times, and technology

324
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,909
are all in place.

325
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,454
Then that means your objective...

326
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,873
Yes.

327
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,666
Our objective

328
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,960
is to publish that book.

329
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,465
It's a mission of the highest priority

330
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,968
passed down directly by our leader.

331
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,179
{\an8}And so, Draka...

332
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,392
We need your memory of the book's contents

333
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,977
to remain firm.

334
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,108
Still, what does the leader want
from that book?

335
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,278
The leader believes
that spreading the book's ideas

336
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,824
will deal a blow to the values
of the Church orthodoxy.

337
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,954
In the leader's words,
"The absolute will be no longer."

338
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,332
Will it really be that simple?

339
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,416
Who knows?

340
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,044
But the potential rewards are huge.

341
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,423
What is it?

342
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,509
If you have doubts, don't hold back.

343
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,387
Very well.

344
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,516
Our task is to carry out liberation.

345
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,227
{\an8}Isn't this outside of our scope?

346
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,021
I'll answer like this.

347
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,692
One could call this
the most important liberation of all.

348
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,277
In other words,

349
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,904
we're going to liberate information.

350
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,495
At present, we live in a world
where information is imprisoned.

351
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,665
That includes censorship
of books by authorities

352
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,167
and mutual collective surveillance.

353
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,962
In the end, we look for cues out of fear

354
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,547
and avoid speaking out.

355
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,552
<i>Freedom of information
will lead to a freer society.</i>

356
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,305
<i>Long ago, at the Academy,</i>

357
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,474
<i>Plato and Aristotle lived together,
despite their differing ideas.</i>

358
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,687
<i>It's only when diverse opinions
gather in the open</i>

359
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,522
<i>that reason is perfected.</i>

360
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,942
Or so the leader thinks.

361
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,447
That's why it's important for us
to shoulder the publication,

362
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,408
release the information,
and free the people.

363
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,870
And once the book is published,

364
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,832
we will use the Reformation
to distribute it.

365
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,543
<i>That</i> Reformation?

366
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,337
Yes.

367
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,008
The same Reformation that recently fought
a fierce war with the orthodoxy.

368
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,011
But they emphasize
the Holy Scripture most of all.

369
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,804
Will they accept heliocentrism?

370
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,183
The leader has a plan for that too.

371
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,103
Plus, many of them
separate faith from reason.

372
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,398
They are not a monolithic group.

373
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,108
Hey!

374
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,528
The conversation will have to pause!

375
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,947
We've arrived.

376
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,097
Long time no see.

377
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,349
Oh, what an honor.

378
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,185
We're grateful you came to greet us.

379
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,731
Draka, allow me to introduce you.

380
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,569
This is the leader
of the Heretic Liberation Front...

381
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,616
Jolenta.

382
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,957
