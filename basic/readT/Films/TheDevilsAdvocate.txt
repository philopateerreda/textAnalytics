00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,434
Go on, Barbara.

3
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,023
We go back to our homeroom
for dismissal.

4
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,193
Unless you have a pass
for sports or something.

5
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:05,030
Is that what you did
on the day in question?

6
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:09,159
No. Mr. Gettys asked me
to stay after class.

7
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:11,244
What happened next, Barbara?

8
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:14,081
He told me to sit
in the chair beside his desk.

9
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:15,540
Barbara.

10
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:19,001
If you will, in your own words,
tell us exactly what happened...

11
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,212
in the next few minutes.

12
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,215
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.

13
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:28,219
He promised I'd get to the bus on time
if I'd help him do something.

14
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:33,390
Then, before I could say anything,
he placed his hand inside my blouse.

15
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:38,353
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.

16
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:42,440
Then his other hand went up
under inside my skirt.

17
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,401
Then, with his hand...

18
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:48,196
he started moving back and forth...

19
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:51,156
farther and farther inside my skirt.

20
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,701
He said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings...

21
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:57,996
that he wanted to see
what kind of feelings I had.

22
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:01,208
I was trying to think of something to say,
but I couldn't.

23
00:02:01,376 --> 00:02:03,127
I was confused, and he just kept on.

24
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:06,338
I asked him to stop,
but it was like he couldn't hear.

25
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,006
He just kept on with his hand.

26
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,842
Then I screamed.

27
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,470
Then he got mad and said
we'd have to try it again sometime.

28
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:16,889
Did he try again?

29
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,683
Not with me.

30
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,476
But with your friends?

31
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,145
Yes.

32
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:26,815
And after you had told them
what he had done to you...

33
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:32,612
they told you
what he had done to them!

34
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:34,698
Isn't that true?

35
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,575
Yes.

36
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:41,620
I have nothing further.

37
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,750
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

38
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,885
Any chance, Your Honor,
for a short recess?

39
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,343
Of course.

40
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,221
This court will be in recess
for 15 minutes.

41
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,811
- Honey, what...?
- Not now, Bernice.

42
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,234
Lomax, what's wrong?

43
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,196
As your attorney, I'm advising you
to keep the fuck away from me.

44
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,323
Why? What are you talking about?

45
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,951
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.

46
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,370
Hey, you're my lawyer.

47
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,872
You're here to defend me.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,751
Know what I think? Why not put you on
the stand? You can jerk off for the judge.

49
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,794
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.

50
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:57,234
Well, hell, there you are.

51
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,862
Rumor was you were out
wandering in traffic.

52
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,031
Not now, Larry.

53
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:07,785
What's the game plan?
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.

54
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,161
Give me a quote.

55
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,371
Fuck off.

56
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:17,127
Mr. Lomax had no comment
on today's events.

57
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:20,047
Speculation, however, was widespread...

58
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:24,217
that the young lawyer's
unblemished string of victories...

59
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:25,927
would come to an end...

60
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:28,304
in this courtroom.

61
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,144
It was a nice run, Kev.

62
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,521
Had to close out someday.

63
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:39,898
Nobody wins them all.

64
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,546
Have you had any discipline problems...

65
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:05,589
in math class this year?

66
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:07,216
No.

67
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:09,552
No?

68
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:13,847
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you
repeatedly about your behavior?

69
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,474
Isn't that why he asked you
to stay after class?

70
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:17,976
No.

71
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:22,939
Have other teachers asked you
to stay after class?

72
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:24,399
Once or twice.

73
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:28,403
- Did they want to talk about your behavior?
- Objection. Immaterial.

74
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,946
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.

75
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,948
You may answer the question.

76
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,117
I don't know
what the other teachers wanted.

77
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,202
You'd have to talk to them.

78
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:42,750
You ever pass notes in class, Barbara?

79
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,044
Maybe a note that...

80
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,587
made fun of Mr. Gettys?

81
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:50,006
- No.
- No?

82
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:53,760
Never called him
a disgusting pig monster?

83
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:56,971
Order.

84
00:05:58,474 --> 00:05:59,932
No.

85
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,601
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
Defense Exhibit A.

86
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:06,438
Objection. We've had plenty of time
for discovery here.

87
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,274
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.

88
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:12,819
I'm also going to suggest
that if you have any other exhibits...

89
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:16,114
you present them in a timely fashion,
or not at all.

90
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:21,202
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.

91
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,704
It's huge hog beast.

92
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:26,791
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

93
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,085
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.

94
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:32,380
- It's a joke.
- "He's a huge hog beast.

95
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:36,049
He probably eats
a thousand pancakes for breakfast."

96
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:40,387
You're writing about Mr. Gettys,
aren't you?

97
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:43,515
It was meant to be a joke.

98
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:48,019
Have you ever had a party
at your house, Barbara...

99
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,729
when your parents were away?

100
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:52,064
Objection. Your Honor,
this is way out of line.

101
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:54,691
- Credibility and bias.
- Overruled.

102
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,985
Answer the question.

103
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,363
Yes.

104
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:04,368
Have you ever heard of a game
called "Special Places"?

105
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,329
You're under oath, Barbara.

106
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,415
A man's career...

107
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:11,999
his reputation...

108
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,711
his life is on the line.
This is not a joke.

109
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,799
Have you ever played
the game "Special Places"?

110
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:25,887
Yes.

111
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:28,932
Is this game sexual in nature?

112
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,937
Is this game sexual in nature?

113
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:36,815
We only played it once.

114
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,526
This special party, Barbara...

115
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:44,655
this was the first time you told the
story about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?

116
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:45,990
Yes.

117
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,577
I've spoken to other children
who were there that day.

118
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:52,746
Is there anything else
they may have told me about the party?

119
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:56,375
Objection. If he has other witnesses,
let him call them.

120
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,383
If I need to call
those other children, I will.

121
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,379
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.

122
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,715
Rephrase your question.

123
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:10,805
You threatened those children,
didn't you?

124
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,474
That's not the way it happened.

125
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,810
You told them to lie, to falsely claim
that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.

126
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,520
These things did happen.

127
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,525
If they didn't, you were going
to tell everyone about this special party.

128
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:25,152
They happened to me.

129
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,238
So you made up a story. A special story.

130
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:29,948
A story about a math teacher...

131
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,533
who was tough on you,
who kept you after class.

132
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:35,369
A huge hog beast you didn't like!

133
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,413
That's what really happened, isn't it?

134
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:38,831
No.

135
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,043
I didn't want to be the only one.

136
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,005
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch...

137
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:48,381
You leave that girl alone,
that's enough.

138
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:51,676
Bailiff, evict that man.

139
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,553
No further questions, Your Honor.

140
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:55,972
I'm going to adjourn for the day.

141
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,310
We'll be back here at 9:00 in the morning
and people will behave themselves...

142
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,978
You made me proud.

143
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,230
Or find themselves in contempt.

144
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:05,481
Good evening.

145
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:13,280
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.

146
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,032
Whoo!

147
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,826
- You go, Gators.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:22,665
In the event that we all get drunk,
let's front-load the ceremonial bullshit.

149
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:25,083
To the best trial lawyer
in Alachua County.

150
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,293
Damn straight.

151
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:29,837
So, Kev, off the record...

152
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:32,549
how's it feel to squeeze
a man like Gettys...

153
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,842
through the door of reasonable doubt?

154
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,302
Larry.

155
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:39,429
Why don't you quit being a party pooper?
Have yourself a drink.

156
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,140
We're not going to discuss
the damn case anymore.

157
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,475
Am I right?

158
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,227
- I'll drink to that.
- Whoo!

159
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:49,314
No shop talk.

160
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,068
- Ah. Ah!
- Whoo!

161
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,569
- Pour me another.
- Hey, baby.

162
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,320
Lomax, you're wild.

163
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:58,906
Whoa, I feel one of them nights coming on.

164
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,411
I've seen the Eiffel Tower

165
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:05,246
And I've seen the Taj Mahal

166
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,958
And I've even been to China
And I've seen the Great Wall

167
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,960
I've seen the Pacific Ocean
The Statue of Liberty

168
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,837
I gotta go piss.

169
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,672
- What?
- I gotta go piss.

170
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,924
I gotta go piss!

171
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:20,176
Okay.

172
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:23,930
Hurry.

173
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,933
- Hey!
- Whoo!

174
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,934
Show me your tattoo

175
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:34,523
Mr. Lomax. Hell of a job today.

176
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,109
I don't want to disturb your party.

177
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,491
"Milton, Chadwick, Waters."

178
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,118
Never heard of it.

179
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,746
What are you going to do? Heh, sue me?

180
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,082
Actually, we were hoping
to retain your services.

181
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,460
We've been following your progress.

182
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:57,879
From New York?

183
00:10:58,088 --> 00:10:59,797
You've never lost a case.

184
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:03,008
I've had some sympathetic juries.

185
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:05,469
That's exactly what we're looking for.

186
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,722
We want you to come to New York,
help us pick a jury.

187
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:15,604
I tell you, man...

188
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:18,356
you're pretty damn good.

189
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,358
Your card is great.

190
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,860
And the black thing, you being black...

191
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:24,945
Whose idea was that? Paul's?

192
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:26,447
That's just brilliant.

193
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:29,325
I'm just not drunk enough yet
to fall for it.

194
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,160
I'll buy you a drink when I, uh...

195
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,496
You'd have to start next week.

196
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:38,208
All expenses, first-class travel
and lodging, you and your wife.

197
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:42,879
A lump-sum payment, regardless
of the verdict, in the amount of...

198
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,173
Well, hey.

199
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:47,300
Take a look.

200
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:52,389
Please, baby, baby, please

201
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:56,600
Please, show me your tattoo

202
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,521
Baby

203
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,403
In the name of Lord Jesus...

204
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,240
we refute you, Satan, and cast you out
and go forth with the zeal of the Lord.

205
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,491
Amen.

206
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:16,536
Romans 16:19 says!

207
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:20,748
Be excellent in what is good

208
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,919
Be innocent of evil

209
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:28,922
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan

210
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,592
God will crush him
Underneath your feet

211
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,556
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan

212
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,642
God will crush him
Underneath your feet

213
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:48,809
Romans 16:19 says

214
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,157
All the way to New York
just to pick a jury, huh?

215
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:58,283
Every dog gets his day.

216
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:03,204
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann
on this adventure?

217
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,084
I gotta tell you, Ma,
this routine's getting awful tired.

218
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,044
Working on Sunday.

219
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:12,797
Working? Ma, get over it.

220
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:16,967
Ma. Listen to me. I love my wife.

221
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:20,304
- Okay? I love her all the way.
- Hmm.

222
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:21,805
Just like you.

223
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:26,477
- Let me tell you about New York.
- Let me guess.

224
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:28,395
Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.

225
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:31,482
It has become
a dwelling place of demons.

226
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:33,107
Revelation 18.

227
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:35,443
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.

228
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:38,529
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?

229
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,699
And what happened to Babylon?

230
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:46,537
Thou mighty city, in one hour
has thy mighty judgment come.

231
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:50,248
And the light of a single lamp
shall shine in thee no more.

232
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,085
Wish me luck.

233
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:57,756
Good luck.

234
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,218
I'll miss you.

235
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:05,514
No. Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.

236
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,431
I'm trying to work with you.

237
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:12,436
They'll be looking for that payment and
if it's not there, they'll repo the car.

238
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,857
Yeah. Uh-huh.

239
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,528
Okay, I gotta go.

240
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:29,285
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.

241
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,163
Okay. Make the payment.

242
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,920
- Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?
- Yep.

243
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,423
We better give her some grandkids soon
so I can get her off my back.

244
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,050
What do you say?

245
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,887
Let her sweat a little.

246
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,501
All right, Mr. Clintine,
let me ask you this:

247
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:23,003
Do you think, as a juror...

248
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,339
you'd be able to set aside
any prior opinion you might hold...

249
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,883
about the savings-and-loan industry?

250
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:31,260
That was a question, sir.

251
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,637
What? Do I like bankers?

252
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:42,521
Uh, Your Honor, may I have a minute
to confer with my colleagues?

253
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:43,856
You may.

254
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:48,067
Dump him.

255
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:51,905
Let's get rid of Number 4, 6,
and I'd say lose Number 12...

256
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,449
but the prosecutor will fuck up
and do it for us.

257
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,117
Number 6?

258
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,581
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.

259
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:03,248
She's my first pass.

260
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,208
And 4?

261
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:11,048
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.

262
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:14,801
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?

263
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:20,015
Uh, look, kid, maybe down in Florida
you are the next big thing.

264
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,392
This is New York.
We're not squeezing oranges here.

265
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:27,939
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.

266
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:33,194
He looks like a brother with an attitude,
but I see a man with a gun under his bed.

267
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:36,321
And woe betide the creature
who steps into his garden.

268
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,198
Number 6...

269
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,866
your favorite...

270
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,202
she's damaged goods.

271
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,580
She's a Catholic schoolteacher, hmm?

272
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,499
Believes in human frailty...

273
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,043
No. Something's missing from her.

274
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,752
She's wrong.

275
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,879
She wants on this jury.

276
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,882
Somebody hurt her
and she wants revenge.

277
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,136
How the hell do you know that?

278
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,263
I don't know.

279
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:08,936
Either you put a stop
to this happy horseshit or I walk.

280
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:10,895
Walk.

281
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:17,193
If I lose with your jury,
you do the explaining.

282
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,362
Your Honor, may I continue?

283
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,032
We'd like to excuse
Jurors 3, 4 and 6.

284
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,499
Hi. You're home early for a change.

285
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,543
I just happened to find out...

286
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,962
I was pregnant on the same day
that I got the show.

287
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,630
Your mother called.

288
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:26,633
She has her bad feeling.

289
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:33,264
Every now and then, she gets one right.

290
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,102
You okay?

291
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,106
Something's up.

292
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:45,443
They deliberated for 38 minutes.

293
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:49,988
Kevin.

294
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:52,240
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

295
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:59,122
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.

296
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,542
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.

297
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:04,669
Yeah.

298
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,671
Except one.

299
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,381
What?

300
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,219
Kev.

301
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:16,680
Not fucking guilty!

302
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:20,518
- Oh, my God. You lying sack of shit.
- Ha, ha.

303
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:22,602
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury.

304
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,188
Yes!

305
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,732
- Thirty-eight minutes.
- Aah!

306
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,027
- You did it!
- My jury. I'm too good.

307
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:36,533
- Glad you could stick around.
- It's your dime.

308
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:37,950
Sorry to keep you waiting.

309
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,411
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
longer than expected.

310
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,747
Good morning, Caprice.

311
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:45,457
Good morning, Mr. Heath.

312
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,917
Your messages.

313
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,881
Not bad, huh?

314
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,967
You can play it cool if you want...

315
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:58,136
but when I first walked in,
my jaw was on the floor.

316
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:01,180
Thank you.

317
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:04,600
This is our home office.
We have many international arrangements...

318
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,770
so Mr. Milton spends a great deal
of his time in the air.

319
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:10,773
- Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.
- Am I good cop or bad cop?

320
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,440
We may not need a good cop.

321
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,192
Oh, I love it.

322
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,405
In addition to our corporate clients
we're representing 25 foreign countries:

323
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:21,575
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa...

324
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:24,786
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.

325
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:20,963
Behind you.

326
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,591
Heh. I'm sorry.

327
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,177
Please. Kevin Lomax.

328
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:28,596
- John Milton.
- Nice to meet you.

329
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,936
So?

330
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:37,979
Have we been treating you well?

331
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:39,564
Very well, thank you.

332
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,733
And your wife, she had a good time?

333
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:45,904
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.

334
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:48,949
That's our secret:

335
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,742
Kill you with kindness.

336
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:55,579
What's your secret?

337
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,748
Uh, I couldn't say.

338
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,208
You were a prosecutor.

339
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:03,128
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville DA's office.

340
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:07,883
Sixty-four straight convictions.

341
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,969
What a number.

342
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:12,887
I like to be in court.

343
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:15,098
I didn't plea out a lot.

344
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:16,724
What's that like?

345
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:19,394
One day you put them away,
the next you set them free.

346
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:22,730
Takes a little getting used to.

347
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:26,276
- Pays better, though, doesn't it?
- Heh, yes, it does.

348
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:32,906
That math teacher, the Gettys case.
Now, I hear you were brilliant.

349
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,574
Prosecutor dropped the ball.

350
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,368
Really?

351
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,203
You think your guy was guilty?

352
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:39,454
I didn't say that.

353
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:41,039
What'd you say?

354
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:43,916
How's this:

355
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:47,295
I began the case with a clear conscience.

356
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:56,178
I was sure you had a secret.

357
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:01,391
The men's room.

358
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,060
Upstairs men's room
in the Duval County courthouse.

359
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,855
There's a hole in the wall
to the next room.

360
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:09,482
I spent five years listening
to juries deliberate.

361
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:11,860
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.

362
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:13,320
Just don't repeat it.

363
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:16,531
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association
would appreciate it.

364
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:18,949
My lips are sealed.

365
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:22,536
You don't really want to go back
to Florida, do you?

366
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,334
Walk with me.

367
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:43,389
Phew.

368
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:50,270
What do you think?

369
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:53,273
Some people can't handle it.

370
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,276
It's peaceful.

371
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,321
My sentiments exactly.

372
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:05,369
Ha, ha. So fill in the résumé for me.
Tell me, uh, your father, what does he do?

373
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:09,163
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.

374
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,749
My mother raised me. Just the two of us.

375
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,669
- She never remarried?
- She wasn't married the first time.

376
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:19,882
That can't be easy in a town
like Gainesville, can it?

377
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,510
I don't think it's easy anywhere.

378
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:25,762
Holy shit.

379
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,973
Heh, different when you're looking down,
isn't it?

380
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:31,059
Yes, it is.

381
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:33,395
Heh, oh, my God.

382
00:24:33,562 --> 00:24:34,979
Your mother...

383
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:36,898
what's she like?

384
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:40,110
She's a preacher's daughter.
She's tough.

385
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:43,904
She's worked in a poultry plant
for as long as I can remember.

386
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:47,783
She's got a church she really likes,
so she's usually there or they go out.

387
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:49,827
They do a lot of volunteer work.

388
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:53,705
Behold, I send you out
as sheep amidst the wolves.

389
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:56,958
So they say.

390
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:58,543
It didn't rub off?

391
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,586
The Book? The Church?

392
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:02,380
No, I'm on parole.

393
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:05,842
Early release for time served. Heh.

394
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:11,305
A lot of potential clients down there.

395
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:12,973
Are we negotiating?

396
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,350
Always.

397
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:19,146
Can I ask you a question, then?

398
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:22,357
Why do you need a criminal department?

399
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:26,903
Our clients break the law
like anyone else.

400
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:33,451
I'm just tired of sending their business
across the street.

401
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:37,288
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.

402
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:42,209
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.

403
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:45,713
It's just the other thing I wonder about.

404
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:49,090
What thing is that?

405
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,217
Pressure.

406
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,637
It changes everything. Pressure.

407
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:58,183
Some people, you squeeze them,
they focus.

408
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,477
Others fold.

409
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,813
Can you summon your talent at will?

410
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,691
Can you deliver on a deadline?

411
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,194
Can you sleep at night?

412
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,572
When do we talk about money?

413
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,781
Money?

414
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,619
Yeah.

415
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,703
That's the easy part.

416
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,873
They call this part of Fifth Avenue,
Carnegie Hill.

417
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,626
Got the park right across the street,
and the reservoir.

418
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,004
Best jogging in New York.
Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.

419
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,340
Some excellent schools.

420
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,635
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list
when he bought this building...

421
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,802
but, uh, great neighborhood
for children.

422
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,263
Great building.

423
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,891
Follow the money all the way to the top.

424
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,394
You got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.

425
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:50,023
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.

426
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,652
- You must be Mary Ann.
- Yes, I am.

427
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:57,696
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.

428
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,074
It's nice of you to come by.

429
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:02,409
Oh, please. We live across the hall.

430
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,787
- You're kidding.
- Right there.

431
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:06,914
It's just two apartments per floor?

432
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:11,043
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.

433
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:13,878
Voilà.

434
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:21,344
Oh, my God.

435
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:24,556
It's what they call a Classic Eight.

436
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:27,558
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.

437
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:31,937
We had them paint it white. Let you see it
naked before you pick your palette.

438
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:33,188
What am I picking?

439
00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:34,690
Palette. Your colors.

440
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:36,525
Oh, yes.

441
00:27:38,444 --> 00:27:40,487
I need to warn you about one thing.

442
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:44,741
There are going to be some
very envious people down at the firm.

443
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:48,411
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.

444
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,871
You must've made quite an impression.

445
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,959
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?

446
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,460
Babies.

447
00:27:56,628 --> 00:28:00,756
- It took us six years to get in here.
- Oh, wow.

448
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:05,385
Unbelievable.

449
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:07,887
- Thank you very much.
- Jackie.

450
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:09,723
Kevin.

451
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,936
Are you really this good?

452
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:16,854
I sure as hell hope so.

453
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:20,482
They must want you pretty bad.

454
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:24,111
Look, Mar...

455
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,740
I'm only getting behind this
if you're on board.

456
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,908
If you want to go home...

457
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,785
I'm with you.

458
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:33,453
Sure.

459
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:36,956
Let's go back to Gainesville,
back to the condo.

460
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:41,085
You keep scrounging for clients and
I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.

461
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:45,006
And maybe, just maybe,
if we kill ourselves...

462
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:50,345
in about five years we can afford a baby
and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.

463
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,138
Are you shitting me?

464
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:00,103
I love you.

465
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,439
I love you too.

466
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:08,069
Tadashi Osumi, Media.

467
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:10,738
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.

468
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:12,365
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.

469
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:14,283
I run the Islamic subgroup.

470
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:17,411
Joyce Rensaleer,
Mergers and Acquisitions.

471
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:20,081
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director...

472
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,166
and Real Estate.

473
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:25,335
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.

474
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:28,630
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs...

475
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:31,091
EC and G7.

476
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,552
There it is, Kevin.

477
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,388
The whole team.

478
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:39,599
Welcome to Milton,
Chadwick and Waters.

479
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:42,726
So, what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.

480
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:44,395
I guess it'll do.

481
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:46,230
Until something better comes along?

482
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,148
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.

483
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:50,025
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

484
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:52,486
Pam was at the Brooklyn DA's office
14 years...

485
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:55,114
so she knows her way
around the local scene.

486
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:57,407
You'll expedite his bar application?

487
00:29:57,616 --> 00:30:00,702
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work pro hac vice.

488
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:03,413
I petitioned Florida
for a letter of good conduct.

489
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,667
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request,
an overview of the Moyez case.

490
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:09,085
The Moyez case?

491
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:12,213
Move, move, move!

492
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:35,276
What do you think?

493
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:38,237
It's a health-code case and it's a loser.

494
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,907
So, what's the point?

495
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:46,328
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?

496
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,455
Isn't everything?

497
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,834
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask...

498
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:56,921
with an embossed floriated pattern
of undulating acanthus leaves.

499
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,757
Lovely, isn't it?

500
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,719
And, uh, this is about what?

501
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,470
The price?

502
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:08,182
Oh, it's about, uh, 2000 a panel.

503
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:11,727
We'll take it. At 1400.

504
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:13,979
You made it.

505
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:15,606
Hey, baby.

506
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,691
I thought you said it was impossible.

507
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:20,568
I thought you said it was important.

508
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:27,784
Go get them.

509
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:29,744
Go get them, man.

510
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:32,330
Tell him, "Cut that shit down."

511
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:36,417
I know what they're doing over there.
That's right.

512
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:40,378
Tell him, "Take all that noise
back to Africa."

513
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:53,767
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Philippe Moyez.

514
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:07,446
Look, I'm not sure
I'm making myself clear.

515
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:11,200
Moyez, you need him?
To speak with him?

516
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,284
Show him your boots.

517
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,039
You're saying he's down here
in the basement?

518
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:19,666
In the dark?

519
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:23,002
Where do you think I'm taking you?
Ha, ha.

520
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:34,847
I thought I would recognize you...

521
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,141
but I do not.

522
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,311
Mr. Moyez?

523
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:44,730
We've never met.

524
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:48,067
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.

525
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,028
I'm here about the animals.

526
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:56,033
We have an investment in blood.

527
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,203
Think of it as spiritual currency.

528
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:03,540
Spiritual currency.

529
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:08,253
Look, Mr. Moyez,
I'm going to need your help with this.

530
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,343
What is the name of the man...

531
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:18,220
who will prosecute us?

532
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:19,889
Merto.

533
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:23,601
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.

534
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,274
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

535
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,652
With this tongue, we create silence.

536
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,361
You can go now.

537
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:37,280
You will have all the help...

538
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,490
I can give you...

539
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:41,701
against Monsieur Merto.

540
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,919
It's arbor green. What do you think?

541
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:55,297
Not with your complexion.

542
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,428
New York City health codes.

543
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:05,015
- That's all of it?
- Not quite.

544
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:11,062
Thanks.

545
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,525
Caribbean green.

546
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:19,528
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.

547
00:34:19,696 --> 00:34:21,530
A cooler green.

548
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:26,493
Ugh, too institutional.

549
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:28,411
I love green.

550
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:33,708
I love it but it's one thing to wear it
and another to have it on your walls.

551
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:40,298
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.

552
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:46,178
Remember, it's only a health-code case.

553
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:47,763
Good night.

554
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:12,036
This is the first time since I've
been 13 years old I don't have a job...

555
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:13,912
or two.

556
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,707
I feel like I'm floating around
in that place.

557
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,459
You know, just drifting around
or something.

558
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,422
You'll settle in.

559
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:26,299
We had this little office in the condo...

560
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,592
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

561
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,888
You know, his side and my side.
Real nice.

562
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:35,975
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on...

563
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,187
If I want to see Leamon...

564
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,106
I make an appointment.

565
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:50,572
- You're kidding, right?
- Mm-mm.

566
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,119
God, how do you handle it?

567
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,580
Take a look around, honey.

568
00:35:58,748 --> 00:36:01,458
Look, you've got three choices.

569
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,710
The Holy Trinity:

570
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:05,961
You can work...

571
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:08,505
you can play...

572
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,008
or you can breed.

573
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,386
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.

574
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:17,639
USDA approved and stamped.

575
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:20,726
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.

576
00:36:20,893 --> 00:36:23,853
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.

577
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:26,230
He killed a goat.

578
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:28,733
And he did it at home...

579
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:33,029
in a manner consistent
with his religious beliefs.

580
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:35,948
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.

581
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:40,952
It's certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone.

582
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,038
It's not as common as, say...

583
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:44,790
circumcision.

584
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:47,167
It's not as common as the belief that...

585
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,420
wine transforms into blood.

586
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:54,758
Some people handle poisonous snakes
to prove their faith.

587
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:57,468
Some people walk on fire.

588
00:36:57,636 --> 00:36:59,428
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.

589
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,263
And he did it...

590
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:05,392
while observing
his constitutionally protected...

591
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,602
religious beliefs.

592
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:12,273
Your Honor, this case
is not about keeping goats...

593
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:15,860
or transporting goats or goat licensing.

594
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:19,864
The city was less concerned
with the care of the animals...

595
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:22,408
than the manner with which
they were slaughtered.

596
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:23,868
Objection!

597
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,704
Okay. Enough, enough. I got it.

598
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:28,413
Let's wrap it up.

599
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:30,207
Your Honor...

600
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,544
the city timed this police action
to catch my client...

601
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:38,298
exercising his constitutionally
protected right to religious freedom.

602
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,926
This is a law protecting
kosher butchering.

603
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:42,636
Exactly, Your Honor.

604
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:46,180
I'd like to move at this time
for a verdict of dismissal.

605
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:50,017
I happen to know a little bit
about kashruth law, Mr. Lomax.

606
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,853
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.

607
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,481
That's why I feel confident
in requesting a dismissal.

608
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,441
Mr. Merto?

609
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,946
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Merto.

610
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,907
For God's sake, man...

611
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,751
- Congratulations. Great job.
- Thanks.

612
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:20,588
Bravo! Bravo!

613
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:23,174
Pamela, you look lovely.

614
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:24,383
So, Philippe...

615
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:25,718
satisfied?

616
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,803
Always, Jean.

617
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:29,054
Kevin.

618
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:31,140
What can I say?

619
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:34,517
Outstanding. Heh.

620
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:37,645
Go figure it, a guy like Moyez...

621
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:40,148
living in some subterranean shithole...

622
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:44,235
all the while he's walking around
with $15 million in the bank.

623
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:45,820
You're kidding.

624
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:48,406
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?

625
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:52,577
Tarzan, we're billing you out
at 400 an hour, my friend.

626
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:56,121
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work
in your immediate future.

627
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:59,249
I figured you came down to make sure
I didn't fuck this up.

628
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,251
Maybe I did.

629
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:04,796
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are...

630
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:07,841
don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.

631
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:10,092
You've gotta keep yourself small.

632
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:11,385
Innocuous.

633
00:39:11,678 --> 00:39:13,012
Be the little guy.

634
00:39:13,222 --> 00:39:15,431
You know, the nerd, the leper...

635
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,601
the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.

636
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:23,147
Underestimated from day one.

637
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:27,067
You'd never think I was
a master of the universe, would you?

638
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,987
That's your only weakness,
as far as I can see.

639
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:32,364
What's that?

640
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:34,449
It's the look.

641
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:37,410
That Florida stud thing. What is that?

642
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:40,413
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?

643
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,791
Never worked a jury that didn't have
a woman.

644
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,542
You know what you're missing?

645
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,795
You're missing what I have.

646
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:52,549
There's this beautiful girl,
just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday...

647
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:56,303
we're done, she's walking
to the bathroom, trying to walk...

648
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,054
she turns, heh...

649
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,847
she looks...

650
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:01,808
it's me.

651
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:05,395
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.

652
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,064
She gets this look on her face like:

653
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:10,400
"How the hell did that happen?"

654
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:15,612
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.

655
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,198
I'm a surprise, Kevin.

656
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:20,325
They don't see me coming.

657
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:21,994
That's what you're missing.

658
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:24,413
- Where's the chicken?
- What?

659
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:39,010
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe...

660
00:40:39,177 --> 00:40:41,971
never loses. He's famous.

661
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:45,933
Never loses, like you. Heh.

662
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,517
Tic-tac-toe.

663
00:40:47,685 --> 00:40:49,853
Come on. I'll show you
the fastest way uptown.

664
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:52,897
Learn the subways, Kevin.

665
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,733
Use them.

666
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,943
Stay in the trenches.

667
00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:59,362
Only way I travel.

668
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:03,366
Mar?

669
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:08,912
What happened to the green?

670
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,914
- I loved the green.
- Honey, you're late.

671
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:14,043
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace
in 15 minutes.

672
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,711
What's all this?

673
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:16,962
All what?

674
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,799
Jackie says the "who's who" of New York
is gonna be there tonight.

675
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:24,010
- All this?
- Oh, that.

676
00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:26,012
It was going to be a nursery...

677
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,515
then I remembered you'd have to be
home long enough to knock me up.

678
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:32,894
So now I'm thinking of building
a law library.

679
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:35,313
Oh, baby.

680
00:41:38,316 --> 00:41:39,649
Oh, tell me I can handle this.

681
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,401
You can handle this.

682
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:44,029
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.

683
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:50,994
Promise me you won't
leave me alone in there.

684
00:41:51,662 --> 00:41:53,038
I promise.

685
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,705
Mm.

686
00:41:57,834 --> 00:42:00,378
There you are.

687
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:02,797
Hi.

688
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:05,508
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.

689
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:07,385
Nice to meet you, sorry we're late.

690
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:10,554
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.

691
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:11,805
All hail.

692
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:15,475
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.

693
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:17,977
Well, Kevin, here they are.

694
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:21,981
Top of the food chain
and dinner is served.

695
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:23,775
I throw these parties twice a year.

696
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:28,696
Stock market, real estate, politics. They're
all players, and they're all prospects.

697
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:32,408
Kevin, congratulations.
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.

698
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:33,742
Congratulations.

699
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:36,328
Bright young lights. Heh.

700
00:42:36,496 --> 00:42:39,581
Oh, oh, you're going to like this.
Come on.

701
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:42,000
Somebody I want you to meet.

702
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,796
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax,
this is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

703
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,422
Ambassador Charles Gagano.

704
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,758
In case you didn't know,
these are the Republicans of New York.

705
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,511
Barzoon always overstates things.

706
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,889
Donald Trump was supposed to be here,
but he had a business emergency.

707
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:58,224
Probably Mort Zuckerman.

708
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:01,227
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.

709
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,811
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.

710
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:04,855
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

711
00:43:05,022 --> 00:43:07,315
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.

712
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:09,192
Excuse me. This is important.

713
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,654
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

714
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:15,157
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.

715
00:43:15,324 --> 00:43:16,950
- I was married to him.
- Oh, really?

716
00:43:17,117 --> 00:43:18,159
Kidding.

717
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,665
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.

718
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:26,792
- He's new to the firm.
- Nice to meet you.

719
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,837
The senator cannot leave.

720
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:32,173
Who's that with the senator?

721
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:35,425
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?

722
00:43:35,634 --> 00:43:37,260
No, who is he?

723
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:39,721
Heh, I swear he can hear us.

724
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:41,806
Hell, he can smell us.

725
00:43:41,974 --> 00:43:44,100
Mary Ann...

726
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:45,560
John Milton.

727
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:48,855
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.

728
00:43:49,023 --> 00:43:51,191
Already swimming with the sharks.

729
00:43:51,357 --> 00:43:53,275
Careful, hon.

730
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:57,779
Ah, Harry, if you keep thinking small,
we'll never make any money on you, heh.

731
00:43:57,989 --> 00:43:59,615
These parties don't come cheap.

732
00:43:59,824 --> 00:44:02,493
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.

733
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:05,412
- Just get it on tape. Heh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

734
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:08,873
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.

735
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:13,336
Hmm. Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he...

736
00:44:13,504 --> 00:44:15,546
buys a few new suits...

737
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:18,466
learns a few new tricks...

738
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:19,926
he's there.

739
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:21,636
It's you. What about you?

740
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:25,389
Your family, you've got to miss them.
No?

741
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:31,394
I told Kevin the only thing worse
than not having a father was having mine.

742
00:44:32,146 --> 00:44:33,855
I can relate.

743
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:36,858
I can, believe me.

744
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:40,028
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

745
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:48,035
The worst vice is advice.

746
00:44:50,664 --> 00:44:53,332
But may I make a suggestion?

747
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,210
It's a sensitive...

748
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,421
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.

749
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:03,007
No, go ahead.

750
00:45:03,175 --> 00:45:06,135
- I mean, you don't like it?
- No.

751
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:08,972
I like it fine. It's beautiful.

752
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,015
It's just...

753
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,018
It doesn't belong to you.

754
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:16,770
- You're too alive for a perm.
- Uh-huh.

755
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:18,605
It's not you.

756
00:45:19,524 --> 00:45:21,275
You should pull your hair back.

757
00:45:23,528 --> 00:45:25,654
Do it. See what happens.

758
00:45:25,822 --> 00:45:28,365
Right now, here, you want me
to pull my hair back?

759
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:30,450
- Is that so terrible?
- Ha, ha.

760
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:32,702
I'd love to do it, but if I did...

761
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:35,913
everyone in this room
who's pretending not to be watching us...

762
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:40,126
would naturally assume
we were fucking or something.

763
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:44,630
Please.

764
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:50,385
Okay.

765
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:02,939
- Heh.
- It's fun to be right.

766
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:06,734
Excuse me.

767
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:10,321
It's a vision.

768
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:14,825
You've gotta cut your hair.

769
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:18,662
Are you serious?

770
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,876
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines
of her mystique.

771
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:26,753
And her neck...

772
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:30,340
if she's alive...

773
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,677
has all the mystery of a border town.

774
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:39,097
A no man's land...

775
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:42,267
in that battle...

776
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:45,687
between the mind and the body.

777
00:46:46,898 --> 00:46:48,065
You know...

778
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:51,401
your natural color would really...

779
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:54,029
bring out your eyes.

780
00:47:08,835 --> 00:47:10,878
Do you have this view?

781
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:12,253
Sorry?

782
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:14,631
From your terrace,
do you have this view?

783
00:47:16,092 --> 00:47:18,009
Not exactly.

784
00:47:18,177 --> 00:47:20,553
No terrace and I'm about...

785
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:22,806
12 floors down.

786
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,683
What about you?

787
00:47:25,393 --> 00:47:27,560
No, I live downtown.

788
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:29,645
This is a...

789
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:30,938
family building.

790
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:34,400
Sounds like fun.

791
00:47:35,944 --> 00:47:37,903
Downtown, I mean.

792
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,572
I'm just getting to know the city.

793
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,991
Is it everything you expected?

794
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:44,617
More.

795
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:47,912
I say we ride them as far as we can,
and then eat them.

796
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:50,707
- Excuse me, Jackie.
- Hmm?

797
00:47:50,874 --> 00:47:52,235
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

798
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:54,877
No. I'm sure he's around.

799
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:57,046
- Okay, thanks.
Mm-hm.

800
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:59,215
Are you alone?

801
00:48:02,343 --> 00:48:04,177
You mean, tonight?

802
00:48:06,305 --> 00:48:08,724
Is your wife a jealous woman,
Mr. Lomax?

803
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:17,816
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.

804
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:19,942
No. No, really...

805
00:48:20,152 --> 00:48:21,360
I'm fine.

806
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:23,112
- Yeah?
- I'm fine.

807
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:24,780
Bet you like to be on top.

808
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,700
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?

809
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:29,952
Of the situation.

810
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,456
You prefer to be on top, right?

811
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,541
Depends on the view.

812
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,962
You know what I see?

813
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:44,549
I see the future...

814
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:46,509
of this law firm.

815
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,361
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.

816
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:10,573
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

817
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:14,160
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.

818
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:15,787
Quickly.

819
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,874
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters
in his pocket.

820
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,251
We'll plant a story
and destroy his credibility.

821
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:23,961
Pam, have you seen Kevin?

822
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,880
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.

823
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:30,050
If he doesn't come to us, he'll regret it.

824
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,862
Come on.

825
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:05,083
Is there more to it?

826
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:08,002
Just this room.

827
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:11,089
And a bedroom?

828
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:13,967
Nope. No bedroom.

829
00:50:14,133 --> 00:50:16,635
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?

830
00:50:16,803 --> 00:50:17,886
Where does he fuck?

831
00:50:18,054 --> 00:50:20,013
Everywhere.

832
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:23,183
What's up, John?

833
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:26,728
Leamon, how many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

834
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:31,358
16,242.

835
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:33,359
What did he do now?

836
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:37,947
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife...

837
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:39,782
her stepson...

838
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,450
and a maid.

839
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,912
When did this happen?

840
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,789
Just now. Tonight.

841
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:50,083
I've sent Pam downtown
to make bail arrangements.

842
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:52,460
They're gonna fucking crucify him.

843
00:50:52,628 --> 00:50:55,255
They're gonna line up. I gotta call Meisel.

844
00:50:55,423 --> 00:50:58,383
Uh, no, no, no.
I want Kevin on this case.

845
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:01,678
I hope you're kidding.

846
00:51:05,557 --> 00:51:10,352
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan
triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?

847
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,688
Ha! You're dreaming.

848
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,526
You know, I've shaken hands...

849
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:21,113
with every marquee defense attorney
in this town.

850
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,407
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.

851
00:51:24,575 --> 00:51:27,744
John, you've got a great eye for talent.

852
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:32,707
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.

853
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:35,001
I want you on board, Eddie.

854
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:41,299
I, uh, appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

855
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:44,468
We can get this case.
The man's our client.

856
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:46,970
He's a business client.

857
00:51:47,138 --> 00:51:49,222
We know him better
than he knows himself.

858
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:51,391
We've got the inside track.

859
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:55,771
We've got the best damn trial lawyer
in the city. It's ours to lose.

860
00:51:56,772 --> 00:51:57,980
Well.

861
00:51:58,523 --> 00:52:00,066
Tell that to Cullen.

862
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:02,485
I want Kevin to tell him.

863
00:52:03,862 --> 00:52:05,488
Whoa, there's Pam.

864
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:10,242
You gonna fight for this thing or not?

865
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:19,876
Pam?

866
00:52:20,044 --> 00:52:21,252
No, it's Kevin.

867
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,257
Hi. No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah.

868
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:27,926
Where are we at?

869
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,226
You left me there.

870
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:41,121
I had a fucking panic attack
until Jackie told me where you were.

871
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:45,359
Three hours, you don't even call?

872
00:52:45,526 --> 00:52:46,901
Stop.

873
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:48,444
Reset.

874
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:52,281
I'm upstairs. I'm with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.

875
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:56,536
There's a good possibility I'm about
to catch a triple-homicide defendant...

876
00:52:56,704 --> 00:52:58,079
who also happens to be...

877
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:01,916
one of the largest real-estate
developers in this city.

878
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:04,710
Mar, I had to bail on the party.

879
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:07,587
You bailed on me.

880
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:09,631
Mar.

881
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,843
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself.

882
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,511
For three whole hours.

883
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,514
The next time you make a promise,
try and keep it.

884
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:19,181
You gotta be kidding me, right?

885
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:22,643
Go to hell. And you can
go to sleep on the fucking couch!

886
00:53:26,189 --> 00:53:29,400
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.

887
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:30,776
Look at this.

888
00:53:30,986 --> 00:53:34,697
I'm not out 20 minutes,
and I'm being followed by the press.

889
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:35,905
They're like insects.

890
00:53:36,073 --> 00:53:39,242
Alex, just calm down and listen, okay?

891
00:53:40,786 --> 00:53:45,540
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ.

892
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,542
This is my ass we're talking about, John.

893
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:48,752
Eddie?

894
00:53:48,919 --> 00:53:52,797
Alex, you know how this town works.

895
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:57,926
You've got enemies here
you haven't heard from.

896
00:53:58,845 --> 00:54:00,596
Now, with this...

897
00:54:00,764 --> 00:54:02,681
now that you're down...

898
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:04,558
I'd get ready for one of those...

899
00:54:04,726 --> 00:54:07,853
Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.
- Oh.

900
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,353
You know what's coming.

901
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:12,398
Now you're going to have to ask yourself,
who do you trust?

902
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:14,108
Who do you trust, Alex?

903
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:15,443
I don't know.

904
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:17,445
I'm gonna have to look around.

905
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:23,451
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.

906
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:27,329
Jury selection started today
at every breakfast table in the city.

907
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,414
This is what people know:

908
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,750
Three dead bodies.

909
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:33,460
You discover the crime.

910
00:54:33,628 --> 00:54:38,006
You call it in. You've got blood
on your person and clothes.

911
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:40,967
And, Mr. Cullen...

912
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:44,011
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

913
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:45,763
How do you know that?

914
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:48,724
There's a second print in blood.

915
00:54:48,892 --> 00:54:52,228
It's a partial of a hand on the wall
next to the bodies.

916
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:56,565
I have keys. I called the cops from
the house. I touched the goddamn wall.

917
00:54:56,733 --> 00:54:58,275
I panicked. I was panicked.

918
00:54:58,442 --> 00:55:00,485
We need 12 people
who can see past all that.

919
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:03,655
- I touched the goddamn wall.
- I'd get in front of this fast.

920
00:55:03,823 --> 00:55:06,616
I panicked. Is that a crime?

921
00:55:06,784 --> 00:55:09,035
I didn't kill anybody.

922
00:55:10,412 --> 00:55:12,330
This is a nightmare.

923
00:55:12,498 --> 00:55:15,959
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.

924
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:19,044
He's right, Alex.

925
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:20,629
People need to hear these things.

926
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:23,173
Ah, Christ, Eddie. Jesus.

927
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:26,885
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?

928
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:28,679
We'll move over.

929
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:31,098
But right now, this moment...

930
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:33,724
you need immediate representation.

931
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,810
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter...

932
00:55:36,019 --> 00:55:38,563
who I care more about
than anything in this world.

933
00:55:38,772 --> 00:55:41,566
They wouldn't let me talk to her
from downtown.

934
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:43,943
They won't let me talk to her
now that I'm out.

935
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:47,530
We need to issue a statement.

936
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,866
He's a winner, Alex.

937
00:55:51,033 --> 00:55:52,617
Just like you were.

938
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:55,537
And they'll never see him coming.

939
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,374
Jesus Christ.

940
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:05,922
I've got some, uh, tough phone calls
I've got to...

941
00:56:09,426 --> 00:56:10,759
All right.

942
00:56:12,971 --> 00:56:14,847
My place, tomorrow.

943
00:56:15,015 --> 00:56:16,473
Alone.

944
00:56:20,228 --> 00:56:24,315
You better be every fucking inch
as good as he says you are.

945
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,658
Not if they were giving it away.

946
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:38,953
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.

947
00:56:39,787 --> 00:56:40,996
- Andrea?
- Yes?

948
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,539
Another one of these, please.

949
00:56:42,707 --> 00:56:43,874
Right away.

950
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:46,919
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes...

951
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:49,755
I want you loose and pliable
this afternoon.

952
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:52,925
Get another bottle of chardonnay
for Mrs. Barzoon and Mrs. Heath.

953
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:56,094
Oh, Lord, this is $3000.

954
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:57,845
You know what you should do?

955
00:56:58,013 --> 00:56:59,805
You should buy it...

956
00:56:59,973 --> 00:57:02,683
wear it once, and then throw it away.

957
00:57:02,851 --> 00:57:04,644
That will loosen you up.

958
00:57:06,188 --> 00:57:08,439
I say spend it all.

959
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:12,235
If you never see your husband,
have a relationship with his money.

960
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:14,277
- Ha, ha.
- I swear...

961
00:57:14,445 --> 00:57:18,865
if Eddie wasn't afraid of me
shouting my mouth off...

962
00:57:19,033 --> 00:57:21,743
he would've put a cellulite clause
in the pre-nup.

963
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:23,954
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you...

964
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:26,790
he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.

965
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,541
Who does it better than that?

966
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,168
It's not my tits I'm worried about.

967
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:35,339
Not too big...

968
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:37,466
Perfect.

969
00:57:39,052 --> 00:57:40,552
Real or not?

970
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:43,597
They look real.

971
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:46,474
They must be real. Heh.

972
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:49,143
Feel them.

973
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,853
Oh, no, it's okay, really.

974
00:57:51,021 --> 00:57:53,773
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.

975
00:57:55,484 --> 00:57:56,526
Oh.

976
00:57:57,486 --> 00:57:58,569
Feel real?

977
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:00,029
Yes, absolutely real.

978
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:02,990
Dr. Robert.

979
00:58:06,286 --> 00:58:07,995
When you're ready.

980
00:58:27,681 --> 00:58:28,723
Oh, God.

981
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:34,061
So, what do you think?

982
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:38,023
I don't care if they can hear me.

983
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,984
I don't care!

984
00:58:41,152 --> 00:58:43,737
I don't like it here, Kevin.

985
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:47,157
And these women. My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake.

986
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:49,451
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!

987
00:58:49,618 --> 00:58:51,119
- Calm down.
- No!

988
00:58:51,286 --> 00:58:52,786
- Listen to me. Mar.
- No!

989
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,163
Mar!

990
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,998
First...

991
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:59,001
You do this radical thing to your hair.

992
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:01,170
Oh, you hate it.

993
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:03,047
Stop. I think it's fine.

994
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:07,009
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.

995
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:11,846
You've got the pressure of fitting in
with new friends.

996
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:13,973
A new place.

997
00:59:14,224 --> 00:59:16,976
- Add to that a couple bottles of wine.
- No.

998
00:59:17,144 --> 00:59:20,355
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.

999
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:23,983
It wasn't the wine, or my hair,
or talking to Kathy...

1000
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,317
or anything like that.

1001
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:27,903
Because I know
that's what you're gonna say.

1002
00:59:28,446 --> 00:59:29,821
What about Kathy?

1003
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:31,740
What about your sister?

1004
00:59:31,908 --> 00:59:34,910
- What about her? She's pregnant again.
- Oh.

1005
00:59:35,078 --> 00:59:37,746
That's got nothing to do with this?

1006
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:43,585
Kevin, I never see you anymore.

1007
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:48,339
And now that you've got this big case,
it's just only gonna get worse.

1008
00:59:48,673 --> 00:59:49,840
If you can believe it...

1009
00:59:50,008 --> 00:59:53,219
I'm actually looking forward
to having your mother come and visit.

1010
00:59:54,221 --> 00:59:55,388
What about the apartment?

1011
00:59:55,555 --> 00:59:57,223
Goddamn you!

1012
00:59:57,391 --> 00:59:59,433
Why do you always
change things around?

1013
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,436
This is not about the apartment.
I hate this stupid place!

1014
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:06,689
You know...

1015
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:09,484
you buy a couple new suits
and you're fine.

1016
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:10,860
It's a little more than that.

1017
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:13,530
I have this whole fucking place to fill!

1018
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:18,159
I know we have all this money
and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not.

1019
01:00:18,326 --> 01:00:22,496
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.

1020
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:24,790
And God...

1021
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:35,299
I am so lonely.

1022
01:00:36,802 --> 01:00:39,011
I miss you so much.

1023
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:41,597
I'm sorry, baby.

1024
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:44,767
I don't know what to do.

1025
01:00:47,229 --> 01:00:49,188
Let's make a baby.

1026
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:54,860
Don't tease me.

1027
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,862
I wouldn't do that.

1028
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:59,364
Not unless you asked.

1029
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,829
Oh, baby.

1030
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,685
Do you have this view?

1031
01:02:02,007 --> 01:02:03,966
Kevin.

1032
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:05,885
Make love to me.

1033
01:02:49,552 --> 01:02:51,803
Kevin. What are you doing?

1034
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:23,249
Unh. Stop. Stop.

1035
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:26,419
Oh, God.

1036
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,046
God. Where are you?

1037
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,008
I'm right here.

1038
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,885
No, you're not.

1039
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:45,895
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.

1040
01:03:46,105 --> 01:03:49,899
Because I need to know
and understand exactly...

1041
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:51,901
what happened.

1042
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:55,487
You're standing there, you look down...

1043
01:03:55,655 --> 01:03:57,281
there's the gun.

1044
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:00,242
Uh, I don't know why I picked it up.

1045
01:04:00,452 --> 01:04:03,329
Uh, it was before I saw Lucinda's body.

1046
01:04:04,205 --> 01:04:06,290
You kneeled down to pick it up?

1047
01:04:07,709 --> 01:04:11,128
You work late, you come home,
you walk in, everybody's dead.

1048
01:04:11,295 --> 01:04:12,837
It's not something you plan for.

1049
01:04:13,005 --> 01:04:15,381
Stop. Back up.

1050
01:04:17,009 --> 01:04:18,968
Two prints by the gun.

1051
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,804
"Right hand.

1052
01:04:21,972 --> 01:04:23,473
Right knee."

1053
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,141
Right knee.

1054
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:28,060
We've been over this.

1055
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:29,895
I'm trying to picture it.

1056
01:04:30,104 --> 01:04:31,271
Your hand...

1057
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:33,231
Your hand came from...

1058
01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:37,444
inside and underneath?

1059
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:43,325
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.

1060
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:55,795
There. Did you see it? Was it clear?

1061
01:04:55,962 --> 01:04:57,296
You got it?

1062
01:04:57,464 --> 01:04:58,881
Whose gun is that?

1063
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:01,341
- It's mine.
- Are you out of your mind?

1064
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:04,844
You're charged with a triple homicide,
you're walking around with a gun?

1065
01:05:05,012 --> 01:05:07,347
I have had nine death threats.

1066
01:05:07,515 --> 01:05:10,016
Give it over. Give me the gun.

1067
01:05:10,184 --> 01:05:11,643
I gotta protect myself.

1068
01:05:11,811 --> 01:05:16,314
That's my job. When the case is over,
you can have it back.

1069
01:05:18,942 --> 01:05:21,318
This is a deal breaker, Alex.

1070
01:05:32,705 --> 01:05:34,038
Okay.

1071
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,623
Let's wrap it up.

1072
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:37,166
So, what's next?

1073
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,753
We need to talk to your assistant,
Mrs. Black.

1074
01:05:40,963 --> 01:05:42,004
Call her.

1075
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,091
You feel confident she'll back you
on the time?

1076
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:48,636
Melissa, yeah, yeah.

1077
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:51,555
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.

1078
01:05:51,723 --> 01:05:53,056
Okay.

1079
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:56,393
We're going to talk to her...

1080
01:05:57,103 --> 01:06:00,230
and you're not going
to talk to anybody, all right?

1081
01:06:01,482 --> 01:06:03,150
All right?

1082
01:06:05,986 --> 01:06:07,695
No comment.

1083
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:11,824
There they are.

1084
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:15,953
Kevin, how about a couple shots?

1085
01:06:16,163 --> 01:06:19,039
How does it feel to get
the biggest murder trial in New York?

1086
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:22,585
Look over here. Are you really
going to plead Cullen not guilty?

1087
01:06:22,793 --> 01:06:24,085
What is happening?

1088
01:06:24,295 --> 01:06:27,505
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.

1089
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:31,968
Well, he always did like to stick his nose
in the camera.

1090
01:06:32,136 --> 01:06:33,803
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

1091
01:06:34,013 --> 01:06:35,847
Mrs. Lomax, did you have a nice dinner?

1092
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:38,224
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?

1093
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:40,893
- Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

1094
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,561
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.

1095
01:06:42,771 --> 01:06:44,229
Speak of the devil.

1096
01:06:46,357 --> 01:06:49,526
I was just telling them the Moyez story.

1097
01:06:49,694 --> 01:06:51,028
Really?

1098
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:53,280
This is your mother?

1099
01:06:53,448 --> 01:06:55,073
Yes, Mom, this is...

1100
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,824
John Milton.
- John Milton.

1101
01:06:57,868 --> 01:06:59,327
Alice Lomax.

1102
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:01,871
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1103
01:07:02,539 --> 01:07:04,582
How do you do?

1104
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,834
Mary Ann.

1105
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:09,128
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.

1106
01:07:10,047 --> 01:07:11,714
This is, uh...

1107
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:13,590
I believe you met Christabella.

1108
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,217
Yes, I think we did.

1109
01:07:15,426 --> 01:07:16,885
And Gizelle.

1110
01:07:17,094 --> 01:07:18,553
Fresh in from Paris.

1111
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:19,763
Great.

1112
01:07:22,141 --> 01:07:23,767
Nice to meet you.

1113
01:07:25,853 --> 01:07:28,855
Three for you and my place.

1114
01:07:29,022 --> 01:07:30,189
Thanks for the champagne.

1115
01:07:30,357 --> 01:07:32,733
Oh, you're very welcome, Kevin.

1116
01:07:33,902 --> 01:07:38,155
This isn't really your first visit
to New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?

1117
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:43,285
Yes.

1118
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:53,795
You've done one hell of a job
bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.

1119
01:07:54,588 --> 01:07:57,465
And I'm sure it wasn't easy.

1120
01:07:59,802 --> 01:08:00,844
No.

1121
01:08:04,806 --> 01:08:06,598
- Mom, we're here.
- Yes.

1122
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:08,517
- Good night to you.
- Good night.

1123
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:11,103
- Good night.
- Good night, Mary Ann.

1124
01:08:11,604 --> 01:08:13,897
Kevin, hang on.

1125
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,984
Oh, how about Cullen? How's it going?

1126
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:18,777
Everything on beam?

1127
01:08:18,944 --> 01:08:21,195
That's a long conversation.

1128
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,364
Want to come up and tell me?

1129
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,366
Now?

1130
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:34,458
Let's talk tomorrow.

1131
01:08:36,794 --> 01:08:38,587
You sure?

1132
01:08:38,754 --> 01:08:39,880
Heh, yeah.

1133
01:08:47,763 --> 01:08:50,223
Is that what you're doing
when you're working late?

1134
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:54,936
- What're you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1135
01:08:55,103 --> 01:08:56,979
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.

1136
01:08:57,147 --> 01:08:58,355
I'm going to bed.

1137
01:08:58,565 --> 01:09:00,816
- Good night, Alice.
- Night.

1138
01:09:14,038 --> 01:09:16,039
Oh, shit.

1139
01:09:19,043 --> 01:09:20,209
Mom.

1140
01:09:20,377 --> 01:09:21,669
Mom, what are you doing?

1141
01:09:21,837 --> 01:09:23,171
I'm going home.

1142
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:25,131
What? What are you talking about?

1143
01:09:25,298 --> 01:09:27,466
I don't feel right.

1144
01:09:27,634 --> 01:09:30,469
Look, you just got here.

1145
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:34,806
And I just got my teeth kicked in
on the front page, so I gotta run.

1146
01:09:35,725 --> 01:09:37,768
We'll talk later, okay?

1147
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:40,145
Okay?

1148
01:09:42,606 --> 01:09:44,732
I have to go, Kevin.

1149
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,359
I miss my church.

1150
01:09:46,526 --> 01:09:50,863
This is New York. There must be
20,000 churches. Take your pick.

1151
01:09:51,865 --> 01:09:53,950
You need to do a better job
with Mary Ann.

1152
01:09:54,117 --> 01:09:56,118
She is not well.

1153
01:09:56,286 --> 01:09:58,871
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.

1154
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:00,678
Take care of her, if you're so concerned.

1155
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,333
Help me out.

1156
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:05,460
I'll take her home if you let me.

1157
01:10:05,628 --> 01:10:08,046
This is home. Understand?

1158
01:10:08,214 --> 01:10:09,547
This is where we live.

1159
01:10:09,715 --> 01:10:11,841
I'm not going back to Gainesville.

1160
01:10:12,009 --> 01:10:13,927
Unbelievable.

1161
01:10:14,303 --> 01:10:15,595
Wide is the gate...

1162
01:10:15,762 --> 01:10:18,889
and broad is the way
that leadeth to temptation.

1163
01:10:19,057 --> 01:10:20,766
It's a little early for Scripture.

1164
01:10:20,934 --> 01:10:23,143
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.

1165
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:49,085
Does my babysitter have to testify?

1166
01:10:49,293 --> 01:10:52,671
We need her to establish
the time you returned home.

1167
01:10:52,839 --> 01:10:55,757
She doesn't have a green card,
is why I ask.

1168
01:10:55,925 --> 01:10:58,176
I would hate for her to get in trouble.

1169
01:10:58,344 --> 01:10:59,553
Tell you what, Melissa.

1170
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:03,056
Let's talk to her first. See where
she stands and take it from there.

1171
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:05,267
I'll make sure
Melissa gets down to the car.

1172
01:11:05,434 --> 01:11:08,436
- Thanks, Pam.
- Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.

1173
01:11:08,603 --> 01:11:11,814
I know him. He's a difficult man,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

1174
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:14,483
That's why we're all working so hard.

1175
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:16,694
Thank you.

1176
01:11:17,654 --> 01:11:20,281
Can I have the car stop
at my ex-husband's?

1177
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:22,992
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.

1178
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,706
George, remember,
no shredding in the building trash.

1179
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:31,666
- Only in the private refuse.
- Yes, sir.

1180
01:11:31,876 --> 01:11:34,919
Excelsior Securities,
who's handling that?

1181
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:37,464
- I am.
- All this has got to go.

1182
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:39,924
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus...

1183
01:11:40,091 --> 01:11:41,717
Mark. No, no, no.

1184
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:45,596
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.

1185
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:50,350
I thought I was the only one working late.

1186
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:53,062
Uh... Ha!

1187
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:55,147
Well, so did we.

1188
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:58,442
Back to work. This is not a break.

1189
01:11:58,609 --> 01:11:59,650
Good news.

1190
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:02,987
We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant.
Looks like a great alibi.

1191
01:12:03,155 --> 01:12:05,323
What a pleasant surprise.

1192
01:12:07,659 --> 01:12:09,452
Looks like you've got your hands full.

1193
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,496
Oh, it's just a little, um...

1194
01:12:11,705 --> 01:12:13,581
housekeeping.

1195
01:12:14,165 --> 01:12:16,208
If anyone should ask...

1196
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,585
you never saw this.

1197
01:12:18,753 --> 01:12:20,128
Who would ask?

1198
01:12:20,296 --> 01:12:23,924
- Uh, Weaver.
- Who's that?

1199
01:12:24,592 --> 01:12:27,719
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.

1200
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:32,306
- You don't know about Weaver?
- Sorry.

1201
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:34,975
Hmm. How nice for you.

1202
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:39,814
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.

1203
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,107
Title fight.

1204
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,234
Roy Jones Jr.

1205
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,778
- I'd have to call Mary Ann.
- Do it on the way.

1206
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,781
Get my message?

1207
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,283
I did. You write beautifully.

1208
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,248
What's this Weaver Commission?

1209
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:02,752
I don't like to micro-manage.
Find the talent, then delegate.

1210
01:13:03,336 --> 01:13:05,712
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?

1211
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:08,924
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

1212
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,051
Excuse me.

1213
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,428
What the fuck are you looking at?

1214
01:13:14,305 --> 01:13:16,431
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?

1215
01:13:16,599 --> 01:13:18,142
I hear you fine.

1216
01:13:18,351 --> 01:13:20,018
So get the fuck out of my car.

1217
01:13:20,227 --> 01:13:24,313
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.

1218
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:26,065
Motherfucker, I'm telling you...

1219
01:13:26,275 --> 01:13:28,359
- ...get the fuck out of my car...
- Shit.

1220
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:32,155
Get out before I cut your throat.
Fuck that.

1221
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:58,637
How do you know...?

1222
01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:06,854
Enjoy yourself. You still got time.

1223
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:10,357
There's a train coming the, uh, other way.
You'll just catch it.

1224
01:14:10,566 --> 01:14:12,483
You'll thank me in the morning.

1225
01:14:12,693 --> 01:14:15,153
- You ain't right, man.
- Oh, I'm right.

1226
01:14:15,362 --> 01:14:16,487
You'll see.

1227
01:14:18,115 --> 01:14:19,157
Invigorating.

1228
01:14:20,534 --> 01:14:22,202
What did you say to him?

1229
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:27,290
I told him if he didn't leave us alone,
you'd kick his ass.

1230
01:14:27,498 --> 01:14:30,584
Look, there's a lady getting up
from her seat. Come on.

1231
01:14:32,462 --> 01:14:34,338
Get some! You wanna lose?
You are on!

1232
01:14:34,505 --> 01:14:38,842
No, no, no.
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now.

1233
01:14:48,977 --> 01:14:50,394
Fixed!

1234
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,362
- What a beauty.
- I'm glad you could come.

1235
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:03,114
I want you to meet my new heavyweight,
Kevin Lomax.

1236
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:05,700
- Kevin Lomax. How are you?
- I'm well.

1237
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:26,512
And say what?

1238
01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:28,764
He's the senior partner at the...

1239
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:33,477
Mar, you're really starting to piss me off.

1240
01:15:42,903 --> 01:15:44,862
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.

1241
01:15:45,072 --> 01:15:48,533
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...

1242
01:15:48,742 --> 01:15:50,785
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1243
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,996
Go to bed. I have no idea.

1244
01:15:55,415 --> 01:15:57,291
Ho! Ha!

1245
01:16:05,425 --> 01:16:07,884
Stop. This guy pays our bills.

1246
01:16:08,093 --> 01:16:11,887
The food, the heat, the rent
on that enormous apartment we live in.

1247
01:16:13,098 --> 01:16:14,890
I live there too.

1248
01:16:15,058 --> 01:16:16,309
Mar.

1249
01:16:19,646 --> 01:16:20,771
Give it back to me.

1250
01:16:22,441 --> 01:16:24,233
I play the trumpet too.

1251
01:16:25,026 --> 01:16:26,067
Kevin.

1252
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,279
Babs Coleman.

1253
01:16:29,447 --> 01:16:30,905
Kevin Lomax.

1254
01:16:31,115 --> 01:16:33,992
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.

1255
01:16:34,201 --> 01:16:37,412
There's Tiffany.
New additions. Where are you from?

1256
01:16:37,621 --> 01:16:39,664
Don't tell me.

1257
01:16:40,623 --> 01:16:42,166
Michigan.

1258
01:16:42,334 --> 01:16:45,127
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.

1259
01:16:45,337 --> 01:16:46,754
How did he know?

1260
01:16:46,963 --> 01:16:49,089
That is so good.

1261
01:17:03,645 --> 01:17:04,979
Cheers.

1262
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:24,164
Kevin?

1263
01:17:33,423 --> 01:17:35,091
Honey?

1264
01:17:57,571 --> 01:17:58,905
Hello?

1265
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,366
Who's there?

1266
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,827
I got a knife.

1267
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:28,266
Oh, Jesus.

1268
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:36,607
Baby...

1269
01:18:37,108 --> 01:18:39,067
how'd you get here?

1270
01:18:40,778 --> 01:18:42,529
Are you okay?

1271
01:18:44,866 --> 01:18:46,199
Oh, God.

1272
01:18:49,454 --> 01:18:51,204
Where's your mommy?

1273
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,792
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?

1274
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:58,294
What are you playing with?

1275
01:18:58,962 --> 01:19:01,505
Huh? What are you playing with?

1276
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:04,049
Oh, God!

1277
01:19:07,804 --> 01:19:11,432
Oh, God! No! God!

1278
01:19:18,898 --> 01:19:20,565
Baby, please.

1279
01:19:20,858 --> 01:19:22,984
Baby, there is no blood.

1280
01:19:23,736 --> 01:19:25,820
There is no blood. It was a dream.

1281
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,405
It was a dream.

1282
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:31,158
It's not a dream if it's true.

1283
01:19:32,744 --> 01:19:37,206
Look, let's get you undressed
and in the tub, okay?

1284
01:19:37,415 --> 01:19:38,499
No.

1285
01:19:38,917 --> 01:19:40,501
I know you.

1286
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:44,338
You'll leave me now for sure.

1287
01:19:45,005 --> 01:19:47,340
No! Get away from me.

1288
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:48,758
Okay.

1289
01:19:50,135 --> 01:19:53,012
Okay, I'm... I'm confused.

1290
01:19:53,347 --> 01:19:54,514
Why?

1291
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:56,849
What is it now?

1292
01:19:59,102 --> 01:20:00,811
Did you like the green?

1293
01:20:01,354 --> 01:20:02,979
You did, didn't you?

1294
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:04,648
We should go back to the green.

1295
01:20:04,815 --> 01:20:07,442
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.

1296
01:20:07,652 --> 01:20:09,528
They took my ovaries, Kevin.

1297
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:12,697
What?

1298
01:20:12,865 --> 01:20:15,075
They took my ovaries!

1299
01:20:15,284 --> 01:20:17,369
I told you. Right here.

1300
01:20:17,786 --> 01:20:20,955
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.

1301
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:28,754
My sisters have seven children
between them.

1302
01:20:31,216 --> 01:20:34,009
My mother had Derek when she was 45.

1303
01:20:34,301 --> 01:20:36,803
You could've set a clock by my periods.

1304
01:20:37,012 --> 01:20:38,054
Baby...

1305
01:20:38,389 --> 01:20:40,932
what are you talking about?

1306
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,019
Kevin, I can't have children.

1307
01:20:45,437 --> 01:20:46,479
What?

1308
01:20:47,147 --> 01:20:48,356
Says who?

1309
01:20:51,734 --> 01:20:53,318
The doctor.

1310
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:56,071
I was there yesterday.

1311
01:20:57,323 --> 01:21:00,325
Non-specific ovarian failure.

1312
01:21:02,495 --> 01:21:03,912
That's ridiculous.

1313
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,622
Shh!

1314
01:21:07,165 --> 01:21:08,249
Oh, God.

1315
01:21:10,002 --> 01:21:11,711
Did you just hear that?

1316
01:21:12,754 --> 01:21:13,838
Listen.

1317
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:17,258
Can you hear that?

1318
01:21:20,304 --> 01:21:21,345
No.

1319
01:21:25,349 --> 01:21:27,767
You're going to leave me, aren't you?

1320
01:21:29,895 --> 01:21:31,104
Mary Ann.

1321
01:21:31,606 --> 01:21:33,273
I know you.

1322
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,442
God...

1323
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:39,946
No, Kevin.

1324
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:41,864
It's these monsters.

1325
01:21:42,949 --> 01:21:45,284
I dreamt about this.

1326
01:21:46,536 --> 01:21:47,953
Baby, I gotta take this.

1327
01:21:48,163 --> 01:21:50,122
No, you've gotta listen to me.

1328
01:21:50,332 --> 01:21:52,333
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Why do...?

1329
01:21:52,542 --> 01:21:53,959
I gotta take this.

1330
01:21:55,962 --> 01:21:57,546
It's going to be okay.

1331
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:02,717
Yeah.

1332
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,762
Fuck!

1333
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:08,348
I knew the DA was holding out on us.

1334
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:11,309
Get the discovery package
over here, right now.

1335
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,270
Mm-hm. I don't care. Find Cullen.

1336
01:22:23,404 --> 01:22:26,448
I get one supervised hour a week
with my stepdaughter.

1337
01:22:26,658 --> 01:22:29,951
I am in there with two shrinks
and three social workers.

1338
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,912
You better have a good reason
for calling me out.

1339
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:36,165
Your wife, the day she was killed,
had lunch with a friend.

1340
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:39,543
"Alex is fucking around
and I can prove it."

1341
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:41,587
That's hearsay. That never gets in.

1342
01:22:41,797 --> 01:22:43,005
Wrong answer.

1343
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:45,508
Your prenuptial agreement's
on file at the firm.

1344
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:48,260
The contract is void
in the event of marital infidelity.

1345
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:50,637
You fuck around, she gets rich.

1346
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:53,264
That's a motive, Alex.

1347
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:56,393
What do I need to know?

1348
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:06,527
Melissa, my assistant.

1349
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:09,405
She wasn't even that good a fuck.

1350
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:11,448
And...

1351
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:13,784
on the night in question?

1352
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:25,211
I was boning my assistant
the night my wife got shot.

1353
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,260
I've got to re-interview Melissa.

1354
01:23:32,428 --> 01:23:35,805
No, forget it. We're not
telling that story.

1355
01:23:35,973 --> 01:23:39,642
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

1356
01:23:42,019 --> 01:23:44,104
- Alessandra, wait.
- Alex...

1357
01:23:44,355 --> 01:23:46,481
- Alessandra.
- Alex.

1358
01:23:46,691 --> 01:23:48,400
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please.

1359
01:23:48,609 --> 01:23:50,277
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.

1360
01:23:51,028 --> 01:23:53,321
- Alex.
- I can't.

1361
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:56,991
This isn't fair. I had 15 more minutes.

1362
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:59,994
You'll just have to wait until next week.

1363
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:04,039
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.

1364
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:07,168
Uh-huh. For sleep.

1365
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:09,545
And she can take that during the day?

1366
01:24:09,755 --> 01:24:11,714
No, she won't be driving.

1367
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:14,716
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.

1368
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:19,179
He's not sure. He thinks it could
be some kind of hormonal imbalance.

1369
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,431
I'm taking you off the case.

1370
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:22,682
What?

1371
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:24,559
I want you to drop this case.

1372
01:24:24,769 --> 01:24:26,728
This case? Cullen?

1373
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,772
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?

1374
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,899
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?

1375
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:33,317
She's sick.

1376
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:36,653
Everyone will understand.
I'll understand.

1377
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:38,322
What about Cullen?

1378
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,365
We find somebody new.

1379
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,201
You consult.

1380
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,203
You live to fight another day.

1381
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:47,872
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

1382
01:24:48,081 --> 01:24:50,041
It's a disappointment. We have them.

1383
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:55,129
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

1384
01:24:57,132 --> 01:24:58,382
Hang on.

1385
01:24:58,717 --> 01:25:00,218
We've gotta talk about this.

1386
01:25:00,426 --> 01:25:03,678
Aw, listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."

1387
01:25:03,888 --> 01:25:05,514
It's your wife, man.

1388
01:25:05,723 --> 01:25:07,724
She's sick, she needs you.

1389
01:25:07,934 --> 01:25:09,893
She's got to come first.

1390
01:25:10,228 --> 01:25:11,728
All right, wait a minute.

1391
01:25:11,938 --> 01:25:16,233
Do you mean the possibility of leaving
this case has never entered your mind?

1392
01:25:20,779 --> 01:25:22,446
You know what scares me?

1393
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,741
I quit the case, she gets better...

1394
01:25:26,618 --> 01:25:28,118
and I hate her for it.

1395
01:25:29,454 --> 01:25:30,746
I don't want to resent her.

1396
01:25:30,956 --> 01:25:32,289
I've got a winner here.

1397
01:25:32,499 --> 01:25:36,585
I've got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

1398
01:25:36,877 --> 01:25:37,919
Then...

1399
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:39,546
then...

1400
01:25:39,922 --> 01:25:41,965
put all my energy into her.

1401
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,473
I stand corrected.

1402
01:25:51,182 --> 01:25:54,017
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant
admit to the affair?

1403
01:25:54,227 --> 01:25:58,063
She did to me, but she won't in court.

1404
01:25:58,481 --> 01:25:59,773
Convince her otherwise.

1405
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:02,776
And when all that evidence
is laid before you...

1406
01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:07,114
when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude...

1407
01:26:07,322 --> 01:26:08,698
you will know...

1408
01:26:08,907 --> 01:26:11,492
that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

1409
01:26:11,702 --> 01:26:13,786
of murdering three people...

1410
01:26:13,954 --> 01:26:15,538
in cold blood...

1411
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:18,207
and with malice aforethought.

1412
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:19,917
Thank you.

1413
01:26:21,295 --> 01:26:22,420
Your Honor.

1414
01:26:22,838 --> 01:26:27,133
Mr. Lomax, uh, we can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

1415
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,509
If it's a choice, I'll go now.

1416
01:26:29,844 --> 01:26:32,012
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

1417
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:33,346
Proceed.

1418
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:40,645
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1419
01:26:40,854 --> 01:26:44,648
I know you've spent all morning
listening to Mr. Broygo talk.

1420
01:26:44,858 --> 01:26:46,066
I know you're hungry.

1421
01:26:46,276 --> 01:26:49,361
What I need to tell you
won't take very long at all.

1422
01:26:50,697 --> 01:26:54,199
I don't like Alexander Cullen.

1423
01:26:54,367 --> 01:26:57,077
I don't think he's a nice person.

1424
01:26:57,244 --> 01:26:59,078
I don't expect you to like him.

1425
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:03,166
He's been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

1426
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:06,377
He's been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

1427
01:27:06,587 --> 01:27:08,630
He's cheated the city, his partners...

1428
01:27:08,839 --> 01:27:09,881
his employees.

1429
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:13,718
He's paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars in penalties and fines.

1430
01:27:13,927 --> 01:27:16,261
I don't like him.

1431
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:20,724
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

1432
01:27:20,934 --> 01:27:23,727
that are going to make you
like him even less.

1433
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:26,730
But this isn't a popularity contest.

1434
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,440
It's a murder trial.

1435
01:27:29,442 --> 01:27:34,529
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding...

1436
01:27:34,696 --> 01:27:38,532
is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else...

1437
01:27:38,784 --> 01:27:43,037
when these horrible crimes took place.

1438
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:45,706
Now, the State...

1439
01:27:46,124 --> 01:27:48,626
The State is going all out here.

1440
01:27:48,876 --> 01:27:50,502
They've got this whole team here...

1441
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:53,296
throwing everything
but the kitchen sink at this case.

1442
01:27:53,506 --> 01:27:55,215
I want one thing from you.

1443
01:27:55,549 --> 01:27:56,800
That's it.

1444
01:27:57,218 --> 01:27:58,385
One thing.

1445
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,055
I want you to ask yourself:

1446
01:28:03,641 --> 01:28:05,767
"Is not liking this man...

1447
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:09,645
reason enough...

1448
01:28:10,063 --> 01:28:11,939
to convict him of murder?"

1449
01:28:14,734 --> 01:28:16,402
Enjoy your lunch.

1450
01:28:16,736 --> 01:28:18,153
We'll talk again.

1451
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:23,492
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me.

1452
01:28:23,867 --> 01:28:26,911
Listen to me like you've never
listened to anyone before in your life.

1453
01:28:27,121 --> 01:28:29,497
I'm gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

1454
01:28:29,707 --> 01:28:33,918
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife.

1455
01:28:36,005 --> 01:28:38,256
Why didn't you say something before?

1456
01:28:39,007 --> 01:28:41,174
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.

1457
01:28:43,678 --> 01:28:45,053
Oh, you got it now?

1458
01:28:55,105 --> 01:28:58,733
- Hey. Kevin.
- Eddie.

1459
01:28:58,942 --> 01:29:00,192
Saw you go in.

1460
01:29:00,402 --> 01:29:01,444
What's up?

1461
01:29:01,653 --> 01:29:03,320
Congratulations.

1462
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:07,241
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.

1463
01:29:07,451 --> 01:29:08,784
What are you talking about?

1464
01:29:08,952 --> 01:29:12,288
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm's charter?

1465
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:14,456
What?

1466
01:29:14,665 --> 01:29:16,499
It looks like it's been there for years.

1467
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:19,419
So now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

1468
01:29:19,628 --> 01:29:23,590
You know, I still am the managing director
of this firm.

1469
01:29:23,799 --> 01:29:25,467
You want my job, take me head on.

1470
01:29:25,676 --> 01:29:27,177
You backdoor me one more time...

1471
01:29:27,343 --> 01:29:30,721
and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

1472
01:29:30,889 --> 01:29:34,058
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone.

1473
01:29:34,267 --> 01:29:36,894
- Ah, bullshit.
- You got a problem with documents...

1474
01:29:37,103 --> 01:29:40,105
put together one of your
late-night shredding sessions.

1475
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:42,775
Ah.

1476
01:29:45,235 --> 01:29:47,862
You think you're tough enough
to run this firm?

1477
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:51,699
Ha! Remember the Weaver Commission
investigation?

1478
01:29:51,909 --> 01:29:53,534
Tell your mentor...

1479
01:29:53,744 --> 01:29:56,871
the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe I'll just...

1480
01:29:57,081 --> 01:29:58,331
pick up the phone.

1481
01:30:03,377 --> 01:30:05,545
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

1482
01:30:05,755 --> 01:30:07,297
He was going running.

1483
01:30:07,757 --> 01:30:09,925
What the hell was he talking about?

1484
01:30:11,094 --> 01:30:13,512
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

1485
01:30:14,347 --> 01:30:18,016
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

1486
01:30:20,018 --> 01:30:22,520
Why does he think I'm after his job?

1487
01:30:22,687 --> 01:30:25,397
You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

1488
01:30:25,565 --> 01:30:27,817
- Not directly, no.
- You do now.

1489
01:30:28,026 --> 01:30:30,736
- 346.
- It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

1490
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:33,823
Uh, he may be out running,
so you might have to page him.

1491
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,200
- It's an emergency.
- Yes, sir.

1492
01:30:36,367 --> 01:30:38,493
You look like you could use a drink.

1493
01:30:38,661 --> 01:30:40,537
Yes. Yes, thanks.

1494
01:30:40,704 --> 01:30:45,041
Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon. Ha.

1495
01:30:45,209 --> 01:30:49,170
I nursed him through two divorces,
a cocaine rehab...

1496
01:30:49,338 --> 01:30:51,756
and a pregnant receptionist.

1497
01:30:52,757 --> 01:30:54,883
Ha. God's creature, right?

1498
01:30:55,051 --> 01:30:57,302
God's special creature?

1499
01:30:58,763 --> 01:31:00,430
I've warned him, Kevin.

1500
01:31:00,598 --> 01:31:02,766
I've warned him every step of the way.

1501
01:31:02,976 --> 01:31:05,477
Watching him bounce around
like a fucking game.

1502
01:31:05,687 --> 01:31:07,062
Like a wind-up toy.

1503
01:31:07,272 --> 01:31:08,897
Like 250 pounds...

1504
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:11,941
of self-serving greed on wheels.

1505
01:31:12,109 --> 01:31:15,194
The next thousand years
is right around the corner, Kevin.

1506
01:31:15,362 --> 01:31:16,612
Eddie Barzoon.

1507
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,420
- Take a good look because...
- Excuse me.

1508
01:31:18,615 --> 01:31:22,451
He's the poster child
for the next millennium.

1509
01:31:23,203 --> 01:31:26,998
These people, it's no mystery
where they come from.

1510
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:32,752
You sharpen the human appetite...

1511
01:31:32,962 --> 01:31:36,673
to the point where it can split atoms
with its desire.

1512
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,551
You build egos the size of cathedrals.

1513
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,680
Fiber-optically connect the world
to every eager impulse.

1514
01:31:45,056 --> 01:31:47,933
Grease even the dullest dreams
with these dollar-green...

1515
01:31:48,101 --> 01:31:52,146
gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor...

1516
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:55,107
becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?

1517
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:59,111
- Hey. Wrong way.
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you...

1518
01:31:59,278 --> 01:32:00,695
As we're scrambling...

1519
01:32:00,863 --> 01:32:04,199
from one deal to the next,
who's got his eye on the planet?

1520
01:32:04,366 --> 01:32:06,367
As the air thickens, the water sours...

1521
01:32:06,577 --> 01:32:09,871
even bees' honey takes on
the metallic taste of radioactivity...

1522
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,832
and it just keeps coming,
faster and faster.

1523
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:15,835
Oh, fuck! Help! Stop it!

1524
01:32:16,044 --> 01:32:18,545
There's no chance to think, to prepare.

1525
01:32:18,713 --> 01:32:21,381
It's buy futures, sell futures...

1526
01:32:21,549 --> 01:32:23,467
when there is no future.

1527
01:32:23,635 --> 01:32:25,510
We got a runaway train, boy.

1528
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,723
We got a billion Eddie Barzoons
all jogging into the future.

1529
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:33,644
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet...

1530
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:35,353
lick their fingers clean...

1531
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,106
as they reach out toward their pristine,
cybernetic keyboards...

1532
01:32:39,316 --> 01:32:41,651
to tote up their fucking billable hours.

1533
01:32:41,818 --> 01:32:43,486
And then it hits home.

1534
01:32:44,905 --> 01:32:46,822
You gotta pay your own way, Eddie.

1535
01:32:48,199 --> 01:32:49,839
A little late in the game to buy out now.

1536
01:32:49,992 --> 01:32:51,326
Give me your watch.

1537
01:32:51,494 --> 01:32:54,621
What? I like this watch.
Do you think you're just going to take it?

1538
01:32:56,332 --> 01:32:59,668
Your belly's too full, your dick is sore...

1539
01:32:59,835 --> 01:33:03,255
your eyes are bloodshot and
you're screaming for someone to help.

1540
01:33:04,131 --> 01:33:07,467
But guess what? There's no one there.

1541
01:33:09,052 --> 01:33:13,889
You're all alone, Eddie.
You're God's special little creature.

1542
01:33:14,349 --> 01:33:15,724
No.

1543
01:33:19,521 --> 01:33:23,857
Maybe it's true.
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.

1544
01:33:24,817 --> 01:33:26,859
Maybe he let us all down.

1545
01:33:36,412 --> 01:33:39,205
You testified
the defendant called you at 4:30...

1546
01:33:39,414 --> 01:33:42,874
to ask you to come to his office gym
for the purposes of sex.

1547
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,126
Yes.

1548
01:33:44,335 --> 01:33:48,171
Mr. Cullen, though,
he's not just your lover, is he?

1549
01:33:48,339 --> 01:33:49,589
He's the boss.

1550
01:33:51,634 --> 01:33:52,676
Yes.

1551
01:33:52,885 --> 01:33:55,887
So two hours go by
before you act on his request?

1552
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,055
10.

1553
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:01,017
I knew it was 6:10 because I heard
the weather coming on the news...

1554
01:34:01,226 --> 01:34:02,310
Okay, stop.

1555
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,730
This prosecutor is no fool.

1556
01:34:06,231 --> 01:34:10,067
He's going to change tempo,
attitude, tone of voice.

1557
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:14,113
He's going to come out with questions
you never thought of just to screw you up.

1558
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,905
So, what do we do?

1559
01:34:18,242 --> 01:34:19,909
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.

1560
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:22,620
Exactly.

1561
01:34:24,915 --> 01:34:29,753
Is it your testimony, Ms. Black,
that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40...

1562
01:34:29,961 --> 01:34:32,963
you were engaged in sexual congress
with the defendant?

1563
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:34,298
Yes.

1564
01:34:34,466 --> 01:34:36,342
At any point during this three-hour
marathon...

1565
01:34:36,509 --> 01:34:38,510
did you lose sight of the defendant?

1566
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,096
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?

1567
01:34:41,264 --> 01:34:43,223
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?

1568
01:34:49,104 --> 01:34:52,440
- You understand the question?
- Yeah.

1569
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:55,693
So is he cut or not?

1570
01:34:55,861 --> 01:34:57,070
Yes.

1571
01:34:58,197 --> 01:34:59,864
Which is it?

1572
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,910
You've polished his knob
three times a week for six months.

1573
01:35:04,077 --> 01:35:07,537
- You don't know if he has foreskin?
- I've had enough of your fucking game!

1574
01:35:07,705 --> 01:35:11,124
Why don't you take your questions
and shove them up your ass?

1575
01:35:27,432 --> 01:35:29,183
Kevin.

1576
01:35:29,351 --> 01:35:30,684
What's happening?

1577
01:35:30,894 --> 01:35:34,230
- It's Eddie Barzoon.
- What about him?

1578
01:35:34,398 --> 01:35:36,524
He's dead. He was killed.

1579
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,942
- When?
- Last night. In the park.

1580
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:40,693
He was running, if you can believe it.

1581
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:42,570
What is wrong with people?

1582
01:35:42,738 --> 01:35:44,864
At least they got the scumbags who did it.

1583
01:35:45,074 --> 01:35:46,116
Who?

1584
01:35:46,325 --> 01:35:48,701
Two old homeless crazies.

1585
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:53,832
Kevin. I'm sorry,
you're due in court in 30 minutes.

1586
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,667
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished here or what?

1587
01:35:56,876 --> 01:36:00,170
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.

1588
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:07,636
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.

1589
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:10,513
You've got to deal with Cullen.

1590
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:14,725
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.

1591
01:36:14,893 --> 01:36:17,728
I can't put her on the stand.

1592
01:36:18,689 --> 01:36:21,065
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying.

1593
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:26,571
She's lying because she didn't answer
you fast enough? She lied to you? No.

1594
01:36:26,737 --> 01:36:28,864
She said nothing.

1595
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:31,241
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.

1596
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:33,493
He killed those people.

1597
01:36:34,912 --> 01:36:36,788
You really believe that?

1598
01:36:37,915 --> 01:36:39,416
He set me up.

1599
01:36:39,584 --> 01:36:42,711
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa, the whole thing.

1600
01:36:42,878 --> 01:36:44,462
I know it.

1601
01:36:46,506 --> 01:36:48,424
Gotta go with your gut.

1602
01:36:48,592 --> 01:36:50,301
That's your advice?

1603
01:36:51,219 --> 01:36:53,888
I'll back you either way.

1604
01:36:55,724 --> 01:36:58,058
Maybe it's your time to lose.

1605
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:01,978
Think I haven't lost before?

1606
01:37:04,773 --> 01:37:05,273
Kevin.

1607
01:37:10,404 --> 01:37:12,739
We talked about this, remember?

1608
01:37:13,282 --> 01:37:14,449
Pressure.

1609
01:37:16,576 --> 01:37:18,035
Take a big whiff.

1610
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:21,288
All rise.

1611
01:37:21,623 --> 01:37:24,750
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.

1612
01:37:31,216 --> 01:37:32,633
Please be seated.

1613
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:41,015
All right, Mr. Lomax,
you may present your case.

1614
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,785
Mr. Lomax.

1615
01:38:24,014 --> 01:38:25,682
I call Melissa Black.

1616
01:38:43,366 --> 01:38:44,908
Raise your right hand.

1617
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:47,998
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing but the truth...

1618
01:38:48,121 --> 01:38:50,622
so help you God?
- I do.

1619
01:39:12,435 --> 01:39:13,893
Kevin!

1620
01:39:14,103 --> 01:39:16,771
I have maintained my innocence
all along, now you see proof.

1621
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:18,815
Feeney, it's him.

1622
01:39:21,861 --> 01:39:24,738
She didn't look well.
Felix tried to talk to her.

1623
01:39:24,947 --> 01:39:27,532
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.

1624
01:39:54,433 --> 01:39:56,059
Honey.

1625
01:39:56,852 --> 01:39:58,478
Mar, it's me.

1626
01:39:59,188 --> 01:40:00,563
What happened?

1627
01:40:00,731 --> 01:40:02,357
Are you okay?

1628
01:40:02,523 --> 01:40:05,484
He let himself in. You need to know that.

1629
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:08,195
Who let himself in?

1630
01:40:08,446 --> 01:40:12,115
The bath was running or something.

1631
01:40:12,742 --> 01:40:14,660
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.

1632
01:40:14,827 --> 01:40:16,828
And then we talked.

1633
01:40:17,372 --> 01:40:20,040
And we talked for hours.

1634
01:40:20,207 --> 01:40:22,375
And I haven't talked to anyone...

1635
01:40:22,542 --> 01:40:24,960
really talked to anyone in so long.

1636
01:40:26,296 --> 01:40:28,089
Did somebody hurt you?

1637
01:40:28,256 --> 01:40:29,924
Yeah.

1638
01:40:30,717 --> 01:40:32,259
Who?

1639
01:40:34,304 --> 01:40:35,680
Milton.

1640
01:40:35,846 --> 01:40:37,263
What?

1641
01:40:38,391 --> 01:40:39,766
He, uh...

1642
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:44,771
He...

1643
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:46,898
He fucked me.

1644
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:52,737
And I think I wanted him to,
but then I just...

1645
01:40:52,904 --> 01:40:55,447
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.

1646
01:40:56,616 --> 01:40:59,618
He just wouldn't stop.

1647
01:41:01,788 --> 01:41:03,205
When?

1648
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:06,250
- Baby, when?
- Today.

1649
01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:11,880
The whole afternoon.

1650
01:41:13,757 --> 01:41:15,299
I'm so ashamed.

1651
01:41:16,385 --> 01:41:17,510
Today?

1652
01:41:17,678 --> 01:41:18,928
Yeah.

1653
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:20,847
Today?

1654
01:41:22,099 --> 01:41:23,933
Today he was in court.

1655
01:41:24,101 --> 01:41:26,936
He was in court
in my presence all afternoon!

1656
01:41:27,103 --> 01:41:28,478
- No!
- Yes!

1657
01:41:28,646 --> 01:41:30,772
Yes! Yes!

1658
01:41:31,399 --> 01:41:32,607
No.

1659
01:41:33,276 --> 01:41:34,985
God, no, Kevin.

1660
01:41:35,153 --> 01:41:37,320
Kevin, I'm not crazy.

1661
01:41:37,488 --> 01:41:39,406
You have to believe me.

1662
01:41:44,161 --> 01:41:45,995
- No!
- Oh, Jesus.

1663
01:41:46,204 --> 01:41:48,122
He did this to me!

1664
01:41:48,999 --> 01:41:51,125
No!

1665
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:53,210
He did this to me.

1666
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:57,423
What did you do to yourself?
What are we going to do, baby?

1667
01:41:58,216 --> 01:42:00,634
What am I going to do?

1668
01:42:02,428 --> 01:42:05,722
Sign there. And your relationship.

1669
01:42:06,891 --> 01:42:10,477
She's calm now. This might be
a good time to say good night to her.

1670
01:42:19,194 --> 01:42:21,487
I know why this is happening.

1671
01:42:22,071 --> 01:42:23,989
Shh.

1672
01:42:24,824 --> 01:42:26,533
They want you to sleep.

1673
01:42:28,328 --> 01:42:29,745
It's the money.

1674
01:42:30,705 --> 01:42:31,914
Blood money.

1675
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:36,000
We just drank it down, both of us.

1676
01:42:36,835 --> 01:42:38,336
We knew it.

1677
01:42:39,922 --> 01:42:45,009
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.

1678
01:42:45,177 --> 01:42:47,887
But you just kept on winning...

1679
01:42:48,055 --> 01:42:50,223
every time.

1680
01:42:55,561 --> 01:42:58,605
I can't look at myself in the mirror.

1681
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:01,399
I see a monster.

1682
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:08,824
Don't do this, Kevin.
Please take me home.

1683
01:43:09,032 --> 01:43:11,534
Please don't do this.

1684
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:13,994
I'm not crazy.

1685
01:43:29,426 --> 01:43:31,928
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?

1686
01:43:40,436 --> 01:43:44,147
- Alessandra, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

1687
01:43:45,441 --> 01:43:47,192
Mrs. Skylar.

1688
01:43:53,283 --> 01:43:54,908
We are here today...

1689
01:43:55,451 --> 01:43:57,119
to remember Eddie Barzoon.

1690
01:43:57,327 --> 01:43:58,661
Isn't she lovely?

1691
01:43:58,871 --> 01:44:03,082
We have gathered here
to seek shelter in our common grief.

1692
01:44:03,417 --> 01:44:05,751
To draw strength toward our tested faith.

1693
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:09,255
So, what do they say? How's Mary Ann?

1694
01:44:09,464 --> 01:44:11,215
They don't know.

1695
01:44:11,383 --> 01:44:12,884
She's...

1696
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:15,010
She's falling apart.

1697
01:44:15,177 --> 01:44:16,595
Hallucinations.

1698
01:44:16,804 --> 01:44:18,430
Milton...

1699
01:44:19,891 --> 01:44:20,932
It's bad.

1700
01:44:24,312 --> 01:44:25,812
Do you have room for one more?

1701
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:28,440
Beloved father. Devoted husband.

1702
01:44:29,065 --> 01:44:30,482
Trusted friend.

1703
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:33,319
Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.

1704
01:44:33,486 --> 01:44:35,362
All of these things.

1705
01:44:35,655 --> 01:44:38,490
And yet one thing more:

1706
01:44:38,825 --> 01:44:41,243
Child of God.

1707
01:44:41,494 --> 01:44:45,247
And it is to that Father
that he now returns.

1708
01:44:45,415 --> 01:44:46,916
Eddie Barzoon...

1709
01:44:47,124 --> 01:44:50,543
such a vibrant member
of our community...

1710
01:44:50,711 --> 01:44:53,504
has moved beyond us now.

1711
01:44:53,672 --> 01:44:55,840
He has entered...

1712
01:44:56,008 --> 01:44:58,009
a new communion.

1713
01:44:58,177 --> 01:45:01,429
And for that it is a time of rejoicing.

1714
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:04,599
God, who is our refuge and our strength.

1715
01:45:06,184 --> 01:45:09,603
God, who is that very present help...

1716
01:45:09,771 --> 01:45:12,064
in time of trouble.

1717
01:45:12,273 --> 01:45:15,192
Therefore we will not fear...

1718
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,194
though the Earth should change...

1719
01:45:17,403 --> 01:45:20,197
though the mountains shake
in the heart of the sea...

1720
01:45:20,405 --> 01:45:22,990
though its waters roar and foam...

1721
01:45:23,158 --> 01:45:26,160
though the mountains tremble
with its tumult.

1722
01:45:26,328 --> 01:45:28,537
We cannot fear too long...

1723
01:45:28,705 --> 01:45:30,206
for Eddie Barzoon...

1724
01:45:30,415 --> 01:45:32,041
has gone home.

1725
01:45:51,185 --> 01:45:52,227
Mr. Lomax?

1726
01:45:52,435 --> 01:45:54,645
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.

1727
01:45:54,854 --> 01:45:56,313
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

1728
01:45:56,523 --> 01:45:58,857
You don't know me,
but Eddie mentioned your name.

1729
01:45:59,067 --> 01:46:00,859
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?

1730
01:46:01,069 --> 01:46:02,194
Staking out the funeral?

1731
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:04,154
Looking for you, actually.

1732
01:46:04,864 --> 01:46:06,865
I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to my wife.

1733
01:46:07,033 --> 01:46:11,245
Just wanted to ask you, off the record.
I have a few questions about Eddie.

1734
01:46:28,678 --> 01:46:31,346
Milton, Chadwick, Waters
is a little more than a law firm.

1735
01:46:31,514 --> 01:46:32,639
But I assumed you knew that.

1736
01:46:34,017 --> 01:46:36,226
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1737
01:46:36,394 --> 01:46:40,022
Arms brokering, mostly.

1738
01:46:40,189 --> 01:46:43,984
Chemical weapons and toxic waste.

1739
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:47,069
Money laundering for the eastern bloc.

1740
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:51,407
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.

1741
01:47:02,126 --> 01:47:05,795
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.

1742
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:08,089
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.

1743
01:47:08,299 --> 01:47:11,259
That firm sets up bank accounts
for judges in South America.

1744
01:47:11,469 --> 01:47:13,803
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.

1745
01:47:14,013 --> 01:47:17,307
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!

1746
01:47:18,308 --> 01:47:20,434
Now stay off my back!

1747
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:26,065
This is a first-time last-time offer,
Kevin.

1748
01:47:26,733 --> 01:47:28,358
I'm learning about you.

1749
01:47:28,568 --> 01:47:31,403
I talked to some old friends
in Florida this morning.

1750
01:47:31,613 --> 01:47:32,821
The Gettys case?

1751
01:47:32,988 --> 01:47:35,448
Eighth grade teacher?

1752
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:39,368
They found him yesterday.

1753
01:47:40,245 --> 01:47:44,040
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl
in the trunk of his car.

1754
01:48:03,351 --> 01:48:05,352
Is he all right? Get help!

1755
01:48:28,499 --> 01:48:30,917
Hey, Marie,
do you want to go to the party?

1756
01:48:31,085 --> 01:48:32,252
- Come on.
- No.

1757
01:48:32,419 --> 01:48:33,795
Horace will be disappointed.

1758
01:48:33,963 --> 01:48:36,256
It's a birthday party. We can sing.

1759
01:48:36,423 --> 01:48:38,466
"Or indeed, His divine power...

1760
01:48:38,634 --> 01:48:42,345
has granted us all things
pertaining to life and piety...

1761
01:48:42,554 --> 01:48:46,348
through the knowledge of Him
who has called us..."

1762
01:48:47,183 --> 01:48:48,684
Kevin?

1763
01:48:49,477 --> 01:48:50,936
What are you doing here?

1764
01:48:52,147 --> 01:48:54,606
I came this morning.

1765
01:48:55,316 --> 01:48:58,652
I kept calling the house
and getting no answer.

1766
01:48:58,819 --> 01:49:00,319
I need to talk to you.

1767
01:49:00,487 --> 01:49:02,738
We got her on the first flight up
this morning.

1768
01:49:11,748 --> 01:49:13,499
Are you all right, Kevin?

1769
01:49:15,835 --> 01:49:17,294
I just, um...

1770
01:49:20,423 --> 01:49:21,631
I don't know.

1771
01:49:24,886 --> 01:49:27,304
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

1772
01:49:27,513 --> 01:49:28,972
- Sure.
- Come on, Kevin.

1773
01:49:30,432 --> 01:49:32,266
How you doing, sweetie?

1774
01:49:33,518 --> 01:49:35,853
I know something
that'll make you feel better.

1775
01:49:36,062 --> 01:49:37,354
There.

1776
01:49:40,775 --> 01:49:43,319
I shouldn't have left. I knew it.

1777
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:46,864
I'll never forgive myself.

1778
01:49:47,907 --> 01:49:51,659
- There's nothing you could've done.
- Oh, I could've told you the truth.

1779
01:49:52,786 --> 01:49:54,537
About what?

1780
01:49:54,705 --> 01:49:58,541
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.

1781
01:49:58,709 --> 01:50:01,294
I was here in New York.

1782
01:50:01,462 --> 01:50:04,797
That night in the elevator,
you never let me answer.

1783
01:50:06,841 --> 01:50:10,510
- What are you talking about?
- I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.

1784
01:50:11,471 --> 01:50:14,681
They had a restaurant downstairs
where we ate almost every meal.

1785
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:16,141
Wait. Stop.

1786
01:50:16,351 --> 01:50:19,019
Your father was a waiter
in that restaurant.

1787
01:50:20,979 --> 01:50:22,563
My father?

1788
01:50:25,859 --> 01:50:28,402
Oh, this is great, Ma.

1789
01:50:30,447 --> 01:50:32,990
- Honey, please listen.
- Now?

1790
01:50:33,158 --> 01:50:34,742
You do this now?

1791
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:37,036
Because, I mean, your timing, it's superb.

1792
01:50:37,203 --> 01:50:40,288
You wait 30 years,
you fly up here, you pick today?

1793
01:50:40,456 --> 01:50:41,539
Kevin, honey, just...

1794
01:50:41,707 --> 01:50:44,547
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!

1795
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,961
I need this...

1796
01:50:48,047 --> 01:50:50,298
Listen to me!

1797
01:50:50,466 --> 01:50:52,842
Kevin. Kevin.

1798
01:50:53,009 --> 01:50:54,843
Kevin.

1799
01:50:55,136 --> 01:51:00,224
Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves.

1800
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:07,731
Oh. Don't you look beautiful now.

1801
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:13,361
Take a look and see.

1802
01:51:14,154 --> 01:51:16,322
It's all right, dear. Look.

1803
01:51:16,532 --> 01:51:19,409
- No.
- Go on, take a look.

1804
01:51:19,743 --> 01:51:22,078
See how beautiful you are?

1805
01:51:29,043 --> 01:51:30,711
See?

1806
01:51:35,008 --> 01:51:36,633
Get out!

1807
01:51:38,136 --> 01:51:39,428
What happened?

1808
01:51:39,595 --> 01:51:41,847
- She attacked me.
- Huh?

1809
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,975
Mary Ann. Mary Ann.

1810
01:51:45,475 --> 01:51:47,393
Open the door.

1811
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:48,978
Open the door, Mar.

1812
01:51:51,273 --> 01:51:54,108
Mar? Open the door. Mar.

1813
01:51:54,318 --> 01:51:57,445
Mar? Come on, Mar.

1814
01:51:57,612 --> 01:52:00,281
It's okay. Open the door!

1815
01:52:00,489 --> 01:52:02,115
- No!
- Mar!

1816
01:52:02,283 --> 01:52:03,867
Come on!

1817
01:52:04,035 --> 01:52:06,202
Open the door!

1818
01:52:07,163 --> 01:52:08,371
Mar!

1819
01:52:08,581 --> 01:52:10,498
Open the door, Mar!

1820
01:52:10,666 --> 01:52:14,711
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, look at me!

1821
01:52:14,879 --> 01:52:16,296
Somebody! Help!

1822
01:52:16,504 --> 01:52:19,006
No! Mar!

1823
01:52:19,215 --> 01:52:20,591
Pam, get help!

1824
01:52:20,759 --> 01:52:22,343
Go!

1825
01:52:28,683 --> 01:52:31,018
Mar! Sweetheart!

1826
01:52:34,271 --> 01:52:36,981
- Mar, look at me!
- I love you.

1827
01:52:40,235 --> 01:52:42,236
No, no, no!

1828
01:52:44,448 --> 01:52:45,948
No!

1829
01:52:46,367 --> 01:52:50,036
Oh, God, Mar, what have you done?
What have you done?

1830
01:52:51,371 --> 01:52:53,830
We need a doctor in here!

1831
01:52:53,998 --> 01:52:56,291
We need a doctor!

1832
01:52:58,169 --> 01:53:01,004
Mar, Mar, Mar, please stay with me, Mar!

1833
01:53:02,382 --> 01:53:03,799
Stay with me, Mar!

1834
01:53:04,008 --> 01:53:06,051
Get Dr. Job in here now!

1835
01:53:06,386 --> 01:53:09,346
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!

1836
01:53:09,846 --> 01:53:11,555
Sir, off! Go!

1837
01:53:12,182 --> 01:53:14,558
Come on. Come on.

1838
01:53:14,726 --> 01:53:18,020
- Help her.
- Out of the way.

1839
01:53:18,188 --> 01:53:21,023
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!

1840
01:53:36,747 --> 01:53:38,456
Finish the story.

1841
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:41,292
1966. You were in New York.

1842
01:53:41,501 --> 01:53:43,585
- There's a waiter in a restaurant.
- Ugh.

1843
01:53:43,795 --> 01:53:45,963
Finish the story.

1844
01:53:48,758 --> 01:53:50,426
He talked to me.

1845
01:53:51,261 --> 01:53:54,054
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.

1846
01:53:54,264 --> 01:53:58,934
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away
from home, someone takes an interest...

1847
01:53:59,268 --> 01:54:02,603
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.

1848
01:54:05,107 --> 01:54:08,192
Every meal, there he was
at my ear and I was...

1849
01:54:09,361 --> 01:54:12,947
That last night he came
to say goodbye...

1850
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:16,741
and I started crying.

1851
01:54:16,951 --> 01:54:18,952
And he told me:

1852
01:54:20,455 --> 01:54:24,124
Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves.

1853
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:26,543
I want to hear you say it.

1854
01:54:29,297 --> 01:54:32,048
- His face that night, I knew it was him.
- Say it.

1855
01:54:32,257 --> 01:54:36,844
You were so proud you'd just come to
New York and done this all on your own.

1856
01:54:37,012 --> 01:54:39,638
- Say it!
- I didn't have the heart to tell you.

1857
01:54:39,806 --> 01:54:41,974
- You wondered yourself. The money...
- Say it!

1858
01:54:42,184 --> 01:54:45,186
That apartment, the attention,
everything out of nowhere.

1859
01:54:45,395 --> 01:54:47,146
Say it!

1860
01:54:47,313 --> 01:54:49,147
Milton, he's your...

1861
01:54:49,732 --> 01:54:50,857
father.

1862
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:53,234
He's your father.

1863
01:54:54,737 --> 01:54:57,822
Somehow he found us.
He tracked you down.

1864
01:54:57,990 --> 01:54:59,240
- No.
- He did.

1865
01:54:59,867 --> 01:55:01,659
He's always been there.

1866
01:55:02,995 --> 01:55:04,746
I know that now.

1867
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,247
Watching.

1868
01:55:08,124 --> 01:55:09,166
Waiting.

1869
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,003
Playing us like a game.

1870
01:55:13,213 --> 01:55:14,379
What do you mean?

1871
01:55:14,547 --> 01:55:15,923
I gotta go.

1872
01:55:17,258 --> 01:55:19,760
No, leave it alone. Stay here with me.

1873
01:55:19,928 --> 01:55:22,387
Forget about him. We can leave here.

1874
01:55:22,554 --> 01:55:25,181
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.

1875
01:55:25,349 --> 01:55:27,266
I can't do it.

1876
01:55:27,518 --> 01:55:29,769
You go home. You go home.

1877
01:55:29,937 --> 01:55:31,229
- Kevin.
- I have to go.

1878
01:55:31,396 --> 01:55:34,065
- I have to go.
- Wait.

1879
01:55:34,525 --> 01:55:36,442
I love you.

1880
01:55:45,576 --> 01:55:47,869
- There you are.
- Pam.

1881
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:50,539
Look at you. You're terrified.

1882
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:52,165
Not to worry.

1883
01:55:52,375 --> 01:55:54,042
He'll take away that fear.

1884
01:55:54,251 --> 01:55:56,835
You don't ever have to be
frightened again.

1885
01:55:57,087 --> 01:55:58,170
Go on.

1886
01:55:58,380 --> 01:55:59,964
He's waiting for you.

1887
01:56:00,674 --> 01:56:01,715
Go.

1888
01:57:14,243 --> 01:57:16,494
You were right about one thing.

1889
01:57:16,704 --> 01:57:20,373
I have been watching.
Couldn't help myself.

1890
01:57:20,582 --> 01:57:21,749
Watching.

1891
01:57:22,125 --> 01:57:23,584
Waiting.

1892
01:57:24,044 --> 01:57:26,045
Holding my breath.

1893
01:57:26,588 --> 01:57:29,340
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.

1894
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,259
I don't make things happen.

1895
01:57:32,802 --> 01:57:33,969
Doesn't work like that.

1896
01:57:34,178 --> 01:57:36,220
What'd you do to Mary Ann?

1897
01:57:36,388 --> 01:57:40,016
Free will. It's like butterfly wings.

1898
01:57:40,184 --> 01:57:43,019
Once touched,
they never get off the ground.

1899
01:57:43,187 --> 01:57:44,354
No.

1900
01:57:44,521 --> 01:57:47,273
I only set the stage.

1901
01:57:47,441 --> 01:57:48,650
You pull your own strings.

1902
01:57:48,817 --> 01:57:51,319
What did you do to Mary Ann?

1903
01:57:51,486 --> 01:57:53,987
A gun? In here?

1904
01:57:54,155 --> 01:57:56,823
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?

1905
01:57:58,201 --> 01:57:59,701
Well...

1906
01:58:01,162 --> 01:58:03,664
on a scale of one to 10...

1907
01:58:03,831 --> 01:58:07,918
10 being the most depraved act
of sexual theater known to man...

1908
01:58:08,085 --> 01:58:12,129
one being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomaxs'...

1909
01:58:12,297 --> 01:58:14,173
I'd say, not to be immodest...

1910
01:58:14,341 --> 01:58:18,260
Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.

1911
01:58:18,428 --> 01:58:19,679
Fuck you!

1912
01:58:19,846 --> 01:58:22,682
Oh. Oh. Oh. Got me!

1913
01:58:22,891 --> 01:58:26,602
Got me! Yes! Wow!

1914
01:58:26,769 --> 01:58:28,937
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

1915
01:58:29,105 --> 01:58:31,981
Step it up, son! Come on! That's good!

1916
01:58:32,149 --> 01:58:34,317
You got to hold on to that fury.

1917
01:58:34,527 --> 01:58:36,236
That's the last thing to go.

1918
01:58:36,404 --> 01:58:40,657
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.

1919
01:58:41,533 --> 01:58:44,326
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1920
01:58:44,494 --> 01:58:45,994
Who are you?

1921
01:58:46,996 --> 01:58:49,206
Never lost a case.

1922
01:58:50,458 --> 01:58:51,625
Why?

1923
01:58:51,793 --> 01:58:53,961
Why do you think?

1924
01:58:54,587 --> 01:58:56,839
Because you're so fucking good.

1925
01:58:57,006 --> 01:58:58,549
Yeah?

1926
01:58:59,007 --> 01:59:00,717
But why?

1927
01:59:01,969 --> 01:59:04,095
Because you're my father?

1928
01:59:04,263 --> 01:59:06,973
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

1929
01:59:07,224 --> 01:59:10,268
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?

1930
01:59:10,436 --> 01:59:13,187
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"

1931
01:59:13,896 --> 01:59:15,439
"It was a nice run, Kev."

1932
01:59:15,606 --> 01:59:17,441
"Had to close out some day."

1933
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:19,234
"Nobody wins them all."

1934
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:23,155
What are you?

1935
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:26,074
Oh.

1936
01:59:26,242 --> 01:59:28,368
I have so many names.

1937
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:31,121
Satan.

1938
01:59:33,999 --> 01:59:36,000
Call me Dad.

1939
01:59:38,545 --> 01:59:40,838
Mary Ann, she knew it.

1940
01:59:41,465 --> 01:59:44,383
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

1941
01:59:44,551 --> 01:59:47,344
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

1942
01:59:47,511 --> 01:59:49,596
Oh, I hope you're kidding.

1943
01:59:49,764 --> 01:59:52,515
Mary Ann, you could have
saved her anytime you liked.

1944
01:59:52,683 --> 01:59:54,142
All she wanted was love.

1945
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:56,352
Hey, you were too busy.

1946
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:57,562
That's a lie.

1947
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:59,147
Mary Ann in New York?

1948
01:59:59,315 --> 02:00:03,568
Face it, you started looking to
better-deal her the minute you got here.

1949
02:00:03,736 --> 02:00:05,456
That's not true.
You don't know what we had.

1950
02:00:05,612 --> 02:00:08,071
- You don't know anything about it.
- Hey, I'm on your side.

1951
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:11,366
- You're a liar!
- No, hey... Kevin.

1952
02:00:11,576 --> 02:00:13,911
There's nothing out there for you.

1953
02:00:14,078 --> 02:00:17,164
Don't be such a fucking chump.

1954
02:00:17,332 --> 02:00:19,958
Stop deluding yourself.

1955
02:00:21,043 --> 02:00:23,461
I told you to take care of your wife.

1956
02:00:23,629 --> 02:00:24,754
What did I say?

1957
02:00:24,963 --> 02:00:28,508
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?

1958
02:00:28,675 --> 02:00:30,343
What did you do?

1959
02:00:30,928 --> 02:00:32,887
"You know what scares me, John?

1960
02:00:33,096 --> 02:00:37,600
I leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it."

1961
02:00:38,309 --> 02:00:39,810
Remember?

1962
02:00:40,561 --> 02:00:43,355
I know what you did.
You set me up.

1963
02:00:43,523 --> 02:00:45,816
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on Gettys?

1964
02:00:45,983 --> 02:00:49,236
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.

1965
02:00:49,403 --> 02:00:51,905
And Moyez. The direction you took.

1966
02:00:52,114 --> 02:00:56,409
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

1967
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:58,869
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

1968
02:00:59,079 --> 02:01:00,663
It was a test! Your test!

1969
02:01:00,831 --> 02:01:04,375
And Cullen. Knowing he was guilty.

1970
02:01:04,543 --> 02:01:06,293
Seeing those pictures.

1971
02:01:06,503 --> 02:01:10,339
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand.

1972
02:01:10,507 --> 02:01:13,759
You brought me in. You put me there.
You made her lie.

1973
02:01:13,926 --> 02:01:15,593
I don't do that, Kevin!

1974
02:01:15,761 --> 02:01:18,638
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

1975
02:01:18,806 --> 02:01:21,599
What were my words to you?

1976
02:01:21,976 --> 02:01:25,687
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.

1977
02:01:25,855 --> 02:01:28,189
Lose? I don't lose!

1978
02:01:28,356 --> 02:01:31,149
I win!

1979
02:01:31,317 --> 02:01:34,194
I'm a lawyer! That's my job.
That's what I do.

1980
02:01:36,656 --> 02:01:38,699
I rest my case.

1981
02:01:43,121 --> 02:01:44,663
Vanity...

1982
02:01:45,163 --> 02:01:47,874
is definitely my favorite sin.

1983
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:51,919
Kevin, it's so basic.

1984
02:01:52,087 --> 02:01:53,671
Self-love.

1985
02:01:53,839 --> 02:01:56,132
The all-natural opiate.

1986
02:01:57,175 --> 02:02:00,678
You know, it's not that you didn't care
for Mary Ann, Kevin...

1987
02:02:01,637 --> 02:02:05,599
it's just that you were
a little more involved with someone else.

1988
02:02:07,268 --> 02:02:08,977
Yourself.

1989
02:02:11,856 --> 02:02:13,315
You're right.

1990
02:02:13,482 --> 02:02:15,066
I did it all.

1991
02:02:15,234 --> 02:02:16,610
I let her go.

1992
02:02:16,777 --> 02:02:21,031
Aw, don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

1993
02:02:21,197 --> 02:02:22,489
Believe me.

1994
02:02:22,657 --> 02:02:23,741
I...

1995
02:02:23,909 --> 02:02:26,160
I left her behind and just kept going.

1996
02:02:26,328 --> 02:02:28,829
You cannot keep punishing yourself,
Kevin.

1997
02:02:28,997 --> 02:02:32,249
It's awesome how far you've come.

1998
02:02:32,417 --> 02:02:34,418
I didn't make it easy.

1999
02:02:34,585 --> 02:02:35,877
Couldn't.

2000
02:02:36,712 --> 02:02:38,588
Not for you...

2001
02:02:41,175 --> 02:02:43,301
or your sister.

2002
02:02:46,931 --> 02:02:49,182
Half-sister, to be exact.

2003
02:02:49,975 --> 02:02:51,935
Surprise.

2004
02:02:52,352 --> 02:02:55,395
Some scene, huh, Kevin?

2005
02:02:57,690 --> 02:02:59,399
Don't let him scare you, eh?

2006
02:02:59,609 --> 02:03:02,778
Kevin, I've had so many children.

2007
02:03:02,946 --> 02:03:06,114
I've had so many disappointments.

2008
02:03:06,282 --> 02:03:08,575
Mistake after mistake.

2009
02:03:08,742 --> 02:03:10,284
And then there's you.

2010
02:03:10,452 --> 02:03:11,827
The two of you.

2011
02:03:14,998 --> 02:03:16,457
What do you want from me?

2012
02:03:16,625 --> 02:03:18,542
I want you to be yourself.

2013
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:20,336
You know, I'll tell you, boy...

2014
02:03:20,504 --> 02:03:21,545
guilt...

2015
02:03:21,755 --> 02:03:24,215
it's like a bag of fucking bricks.

2016
02:03:24,382 --> 02:03:25,966
All you gotta do...

2017
02:03:26,133 --> 02:03:28,343
is set it down.

2018
02:03:29,512 --> 02:03:30,845
Hey.

2019
02:03:31,013 --> 02:03:33,306
I know what you're going through.

2020
02:03:33,474 --> 02:03:34,724
I've been there.

2021
02:03:34,892 --> 02:03:36,810
Just come here. Come here.

2022
02:03:36,978 --> 02:03:38,812
Yeah. Let it go.

2023
02:03:40,022 --> 02:03:42,565
Uh, I can't do that.

2024
02:03:45,276 --> 02:03:48,612
Who are you carrying
all those bricks for anyway?

2025
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:50,447
God?

2026
02:03:50,615 --> 02:03:52,074
Is that it?

2027
02:03:52,242 --> 02:03:53,325
God?

2028
02:03:53,493 --> 02:03:54,702
I'll tell you...

2029
02:03:54,869 --> 02:03:58,831
let me give you
a little inside information about God.

2030
02:03:58,998 --> 02:04:00,999
God likes to watch.

2031
02:04:01,166 --> 02:04:02,333
He's a prankster.

2032
02:04:02,501 --> 02:04:04,168
Think about it.

2033
02:04:04,336 --> 02:04:05,753
He gives man...

2034
02:04:05,921 --> 02:04:07,755
instincts.

2035
02:04:08,048 --> 02:04:11,884
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does he do?

2036
02:04:12,052 --> 02:04:14,846
I swear, for his own amusement...

2037
02:04:15,013 --> 02:04:20,183
his own private, cosmic gag reel...

2038
02:04:20,351 --> 02:04:22,436
he sets the rules in opposition.

2039
02:04:22,645 --> 02:04:24,062
It's the goof of all time.

2040
02:04:24,272 --> 02:04:26,982
Look, but don't touch.

2041
02:04:28,234 --> 02:04:31,486
Touch, but don't taste.

2042
02:04:32,404 --> 02:04:34,405
Taste, but don't swallow.

2043
02:04:35,991 --> 02:04:39,994
And while you're jumping from one foot
to the next, what is he doing?

2044
02:04:40,162 --> 02:04:43,789
He's laughing his sick fucking ass off!

2045
02:04:43,957 --> 02:04:45,458
He's a tightass!

2046
02:04:45,625 --> 02:04:48,044
He's a sadist!

2047
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:51,046
He's an absentee landlord!

2048
02:04:51,213 --> 02:04:53,965
Worship that? Never!

2049
02:04:54,133 --> 02:04:57,260
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven, is that it?

2050
02:04:57,470 --> 02:04:58,928
Why not?

2051
02:04:59,096 --> 02:05:03,600
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began.

2052
02:05:04,434 --> 02:05:09,188
I've nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have.

2053
02:05:09,355 --> 02:05:12,983
I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him.

2054
02:05:13,151 --> 02:05:17,780
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections.

2055
02:05:17,947 --> 02:05:19,615
I'm a fan of man!

2056
02:05:21,784 --> 02:05:23,618
I'm a humanist.

2057
02:05:23,786 --> 02:05:25,536
Maybe the last humanist.

2058
02:05:26,413 --> 02:05:28,498
Who, in their right mind...

2059
02:05:28,665 --> 02:05:30,833
Kevin, could possibly deny...

2060
02:05:31,043 --> 02:05:34,003
the 20th century was entirely mine?

2061
02:05:34,171 --> 02:05:36,714
All of it, Kevin!

2062
02:05:36,882 --> 02:05:38,841
All of it!

2063
02:05:39,342 --> 02:05:41,134
Mine.

2064
02:05:41,344 --> 02:05:43,512
I'm peaking, Kevin.

2065
02:05:44,305 --> 02:05:46,515
It's my time now.

2066
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:49,142
It's our time.

2067
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:51,520
Anybody want a drink?

2068
02:05:52,897 --> 02:05:54,981
I'm having a drink.

2069
02:05:57,734 --> 02:06:00,486
This is some pitch, all this.

2070
02:06:01,113 --> 02:06:03,114
You must need me pretty bad.

2071
02:06:03,281 --> 02:06:04,824
What do you want?

2072
02:06:05,784 --> 02:06:07,743
Eddie was right.

2073
02:06:08,411 --> 02:06:11,080
I want you to take over the firm.

2074
02:06:11,247 --> 02:06:12,956
You...

2075
02:06:13,541 --> 02:06:15,708
and your sister.

2076
02:06:19,255 --> 02:06:22,090
- Is that it?
- No.

2077
02:06:23,759 --> 02:06:25,426
She's ovulating...

2078
02:06:25,594 --> 02:06:28,096
right now.
- What?

2079
02:06:28,263 --> 02:06:29,930
Your vanity...

2080
02:06:30,098 --> 02:06:32,558
is justified, Kevin.

2081
02:06:33,852 --> 02:06:35,144
Your seed...

2082
02:06:35,311 --> 02:06:37,771
is the key to a new future.

2083
02:06:37,939 --> 02:06:41,900
Your son is going to sit
at the head of all tables, my boy.

2084
02:06:42,068 --> 02:06:44,778
He's gonna set this whole thing free.

2085
02:06:46,113 --> 02:06:48,072
You want a child.

2086
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,907
I want a family.

2087
02:06:50,951 --> 02:06:53,119
The Antichrist.

2088
02:06:57,332 --> 02:06:58,541
Whatever.

2089
02:07:03,004 --> 02:07:05,672
But I have to volunteer.

2090
02:07:06,966 --> 02:07:10,427
Free will, it is a bitch.

2091
02:07:11,804 --> 02:07:14,431
Kevin, I need a family.

2092
02:07:14,599 --> 02:07:16,600
I need help. I'm busy.

2093
02:07:16,767 --> 02:07:18,643
Millennium's coming, son.

2094
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:22,479
Title fight. Round 20. Ha, ha.

2095
02:07:23,565 --> 02:07:25,941
Ooh. I'm ready to work.

2096
02:07:27,027 --> 02:07:28,944
What do you say, kid?

2097
02:07:29,362 --> 02:07:31,280
What're you offering?

2098
02:07:33,867 --> 02:07:34,950
Are we negotiating?

2099
02:07:35,117 --> 02:07:36,951
Always.

2100
02:07:38,746 --> 02:07:40,580
Yes.

2101
02:07:41,332 --> 02:07:43,374
What are you offering?

2102
02:07:43,709 --> 02:07:44,959
Everything.

2103
02:07:45,169 --> 02:07:46,336
Anything.

2104
02:07:46,545 --> 02:07:48,838
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?

2105
02:07:49,048 --> 02:07:52,926
Instant bliss. Bliss on tap. Ha, ha.

2106
02:07:53,092 --> 02:07:55,886
Bliss any way you want it.

2107
02:07:58,014 --> 02:08:00,724
How about that first line of cocaine?

2108
02:08:00,892 --> 02:08:03,936
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.

2109
02:08:05,438 --> 02:08:06,939
Familiar?

2110
02:08:07,732 --> 02:08:10,609
Oh, you're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

2111
02:08:10,776 --> 02:08:12,235
I know.

2112
02:08:12,736 --> 02:08:14,737
I'm just getting warmed up.

2113
02:08:14,905 --> 02:08:18,491
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.

2114
02:08:18,659 --> 02:08:21,035
How about the thing you love the most?

2115
02:08:21,536 --> 02:08:23,371
A smile from a jury.

2116
02:08:23,538 --> 02:08:28,501
Whew. That cold courtroom
just giving itself over...

2117
02:08:28,668 --> 02:08:31,878
bending to your strength.

2118
02:08:32,546 --> 02:08:34,172
I get that on my own.

2119
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:36,091
Not like this.

2120
02:08:36,259 --> 02:08:38,551
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.

2121
02:08:38,761 --> 02:08:40,971
I give you pleasure.

2122
02:08:41,389 --> 02:08:42,681
No strings!

2123
02:08:42,847 --> 02:08:44,640
Freedom, baby...

2124
02:08:44,808 --> 02:08:47,559
is never having to say you're sorry.

2125
02:08:48,812 --> 02:08:50,521
This is revolution, Kevin.

2126
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:58,112
It happened in Monterey

2127
02:08:58,654 --> 02:09:01,197
A long time ago

2128
02:09:01,365 --> 02:09:02,907
Forget about him.

2129
02:09:03,617 --> 02:09:05,076
This is about us.

2130
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:08,621
In old Mexico

2131
02:09:10,582 --> 02:09:16,212
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine

2132
02:09:16,379 --> 02:09:19,548
You don't know how hard it's been
for me to wait for you.

2133
02:09:20,133 --> 02:09:21,967
Why the law?

2134
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:25,262
Cut the shit, Dad. Why lawyers?
Why the law?

2135
02:09:26,764 --> 02:09:29,641
Because the law, my boy,
puts us into everything.

2136
02:09:30,643 --> 02:09:35,814
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.

2137
02:09:35,981 --> 02:09:38,774
Did you know there are more students
in law school...

2138
02:09:38,942 --> 02:09:40,860
than lawyers walking the Earth?

2139
02:09:41,028 --> 02:09:42,737
We're coming out...

2140
02:09:42,904 --> 02:09:44,864
guns blazing!

2141
02:09:46,408 --> 02:09:47,992
The two of you...

2142
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:52,038
all of us, acquittal after
acquittal after acquittal...

2143
02:09:52,204 --> 02:09:55,915
until the stench of it reaches
so high and far into Heaven...

2144
02:09:56,083 --> 02:09:59,502
it chokes the whole fucking lot of them.

2145
02:10:01,505 --> 02:10:03,631
In the Bible, you lose.

2146
02:10:04,925 --> 02:10:06,926
We're destined to lose, Dad.

2147
02:10:07,093 --> 02:10:09,928
Consider the source, son.

2148
02:10:11,056 --> 02:10:12,097
Besides...

2149
02:10:12,265 --> 02:10:13,932
we'll write our own book.

2150
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:16,435
Chapter one.

2151
02:10:17,103 --> 02:10:19,355
Right here. This altar.

2152
02:10:20,023 --> 02:10:21,523
This moment.

2153
02:10:21,690 --> 02:10:23,316
Will you stop talking?

2154
02:10:23,484 --> 02:10:25,276
You talk too much.

2155
02:10:25,444 --> 02:10:27,320
Both of you.

2156
02:10:28,072 --> 02:10:29,781
Kevin.

2157
02:10:29,948 --> 02:10:31,783
Look at me.

2158
02:10:32,701 --> 02:10:34,577
Just look at me.

2159
02:10:43,461 --> 02:10:47,756
Oh. She is really stunning.

2160
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:54,679
Who am I?

2161
02:11:14,407 --> 02:11:17,659
I've wanted you from the moment we met.

2162
02:11:26,502 --> 02:11:29,712
The virtue of the devil is in his loins.

2163
02:11:33,383 --> 02:11:34,633
What about love?

2164
02:11:38,763 --> 02:11:40,055
Overrated.

2165
02:11:40,223 --> 02:11:46,186
Biochemically no different than eating
large quantities of chocolate.

2166
02:11:46,353 --> 02:11:51,357
Hey. In two minutes you won't be thinking
about Mary Ann ever again.

2167
02:11:51,525 --> 02:11:52,900
Come here.

2168
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:56,320
She's right, my son.

2169
02:12:03,244 --> 02:12:07,664
It's time to step up
and take what's yours.

2170
02:12:12,044 --> 02:12:13,712
You're right.

2171
02:12:15,673 --> 02:12:17,174
It's time.

2172
02:12:17,633 --> 02:12:20,010
Free will, right? Heh.

2173
02:12:24,556 --> 02:12:25,931
No!

2174
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:29,810
- No!
- No!

2175
02:12:31,563 --> 02:12:35,232
No!

2176
02:12:39,612 --> 02:12:43,114
Damn you!

2177
02:12:44,533 --> 02:12:46,409
Enough!

2178
02:12:48,496 --> 02:12:51,039
Haven't I given enough?

2179
02:13:55,058 --> 02:13:56,684
It was a nice run, Kev.

2180
02:13:56,851 --> 02:13:58,978
Had to close out someday.

2181
02:13:59,645 --> 02:14:01,104
Nobody wins them all.

2182
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:52,694
What are you doing, baby?

2183
02:14:54,697 --> 02:14:56,156
Are you okay?

2184
02:14:59,410 --> 02:15:01,161
I am now.

2185
02:15:04,373 --> 02:15:05,957
All rise.

2186
02:15:06,374 --> 02:15:09,960
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds
presiding.

2187
02:15:12,380 --> 02:15:14,381
Please be seated.

2188
02:15:17,969 --> 02:15:20,638
You're still under oath, young lady.

2189
02:15:23,766 --> 02:15:26,309
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

2190
02:15:36,904 --> 02:15:38,404
Mr. Lomax?

2191
02:15:43,076 --> 02:15:44,284
Your Honor...

2192
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:48,121
I'm terribly sorry.

2193
02:15:49,415 --> 02:15:51,833
But I can no longer represent my client.

2194
02:15:54,712 --> 02:15:56,630
I need to be replaced as counsel.

2195
02:15:56,838 --> 02:15:59,965
Order. Order! Order!

2196
02:16:00,133 --> 02:16:02,176
I adjourn this court.

2197
02:16:02,344 --> 02:16:05,846
This is outrageous. Are you aware
of the consequences of this action?

2198
02:16:06,014 --> 02:16:07,223
I am, sir.

2199
02:16:07,391 --> 02:16:10,976
I want to see both attorneys
in my chambers immediately.

2200
02:16:11,144 --> 02:16:14,855
I'm going to adjourn this trial
until 9 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

2201
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:17,691
I trusted you to defend me.

2202
02:16:17,858 --> 02:16:20,026
You swore you would. You'll burn for this.

2203
02:16:20,194 --> 02:16:22,779
You just made the biggest mistake
of your life.

2204
02:16:23,823 --> 02:16:26,324
Baby, what are you doing?

2205
02:16:29,411 --> 02:16:31,203
The right thing.

2206
02:16:31,371 --> 02:16:33,664
I think the right thing.

2207
02:16:36,918 --> 02:16:37,960
Here they are.

2208
02:16:38,128 --> 02:16:40,295
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.

2209
02:16:40,463 --> 02:16:43,006
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.

2210
02:16:43,216 --> 02:16:45,426
Ain't it better to talk
to them all at once?

2211
02:16:45,593 --> 02:16:47,136
Press conference tomorrow?

2212
02:16:47,344 --> 02:16:50,638
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

2213
02:16:50,848 --> 02:16:52,098
That's it.

2214
02:16:52,307 --> 02:16:53,975
This is the story you dreamed about.

2215
02:16:54,184 --> 02:16:56,644
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.

2216
02:16:56,854 --> 02:17:00,189
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge.

2217
02:17:00,399 --> 02:17:04,026
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.

2218
02:17:04,193 --> 02:17:08,113
- Wait a second. Can they do that?
- Not when I get through with the story.

2219
02:17:08,281 --> 02:17:10,657
You got to give me an exclusive.

2220
02:17:10,825 --> 02:17:14,494
This is wire service. This is 60 Minutes.

2221
02:17:14,704 --> 02:17:18,373
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.

2222
02:17:18,541 --> 02:17:20,333
You're a star.

2223
02:17:24,171 --> 02:17:25,671
Baby.

2224
02:17:27,174 --> 02:17:29,675
Heh. Call me in the morning.

2225
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:33,512
You got it. First thing.

2226
02:17:33,930 --> 02:17:35,931
Bye, Larry.

2227
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:43,938
Vanity.

2228
02:17:44,106 --> 02:17:46,900
Definitely my favorite sin.
